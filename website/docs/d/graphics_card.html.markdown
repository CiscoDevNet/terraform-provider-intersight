# Data Source: intersight_graphics_card
Graphics Card present in a server.
## Argument Reference
The results of this data source are stored in `results` property.
All objects matching the filter criteria are fetched through pagination.
To access the ith object of the results obtained, use `data.intersight_graphics_card.<custom_name>.results[i].<propertyname>`.
The following arguments can be used to get data of already created objects in Intersight appliance:
* `account_moid`:(string) The Account ID for this managed object. 
* `card_id`:(int) The id of the graphics card. 
* `create_time`:(string) The time when this managed object was created. 
* `description`:(string) This field displays the description of the Graphics Processing Unit. 
* `device_id`:(int) The device id of the graphics card. 
* `device_mo_id`:(string) The database identifier of the registered device of an object. 
* `dn`:(string) The Distinguished Name unambiguously identifies an object in the system. 
* `domain_group_moid`:(string) The DomainGroup ID for this managed object. 
* `expander_slot`:(string) The expander slot information of the card.
