# Data Source: intersight_workflow_workflow_definition
Workflow definition is a collection of tasks that are sequenced in a certain way using control tasks. The tasks in the workflow definition is represented as a directed acyclic graph where each node in the graph is a task and the edges in the graph are transitions from one task to another.
## Argument Reference
The results of this data source are stored in `results` property.
All objects matching the filter criteria are fetched through pagination.
To access the ith object of the results obtained, use `data.intersight_workflow_workflow_definition.<custom_name>.results[i].<propertyname>`.
The following arguments can be used to get data of already created objects in Intersight appliance:
* `account_moid`:(string) The Account ID for this managed object. 
* `create_time`:(string) The time when this managed object was created. 
* `create_user`:(string) The user identifier who created or cloned the workflow definition. 
* `default_version`:(bool) When true this will be the workflow version that is used when a specific workflow definition version is not specified. The default version is used when user executes a workflow without specifying a version or when workflow is included in another workflow without a specific version. The very first workflow definition created with a name will be set as the default version, after that user can explicitly set any version of the workflow definition as the default version. 
* `description`:(string) The description for this workflow. 
* `domain_group_moid`:(string) The DomainGroup ID for this managed object. 
* `label`:(string) A user friendly short name to identify the workflow. Label can only contain letters (a-z, A-Z), numbers (0-9), hyphen (-), period (.), colon (:), space ( ), forward slash (/), or an underscore (_). 
* `license_entitlement`:(string) License entitlement required to run this workflow. It is calculated based on the highest license requirement of all its tasks.* `Base` - Base as a License type. It is default license type.* `Essential` - Essential as a License type.* `Standard` - Standard as a License type.* `Advantage` - Advantage as a License type.* `Premier` - Premier as a License type.* `IWO-Essential` - IWO-Essential as a License type.* `IWO-Advantage` - IWO-Advantage as a License type.* `IWO-Premier` - IWO-Premier as a License type.* `IKS-Advantage` - IKS-Advantage as a License type.* `INC-Premier-1GFixed` - Premier 1G Fixed license tier for Intersight Nexus Cloud.* `INC-Premier-10GFixed` - Premier 10G Fixed license tier for Intersight Nexus Cloud.* `INC-Premier-100GFixed` - Premier 100G Fixed license tier for Intersight Nexus Cloud.* `INC-Premier-Mod4Slot` - Premier Modular 4 slot license tier for Intersight Nexus Cloud.* `INC-Premier-Mod8Slot` - Premier Modular 8 slot license tier for Intersight Nexus Cloud.* `INC-Premier-D2OpsFixed` - Premier D2Ops fixed license tier for Intersight Nexus Cloud.* `INC-Premier-D2OpsMod` - Premier D2Ops modular license tier for Intersight Nexus Cloud.* `INC-Premier-CentralizedMod8Slot` - Premier modular license tier of switch type CentralizedMod8Slot for Intersight Nexus Cloud.* `INC-Premier-DistributedMod8Slot` - Premier modular license tier of switch type DistributedMod8Slot for Intersight Nexus Cloud.* `ERP-Advantage` - Advantage license tier for ERP workflows.* `IntersightTrial` - Virtual dummy license type to indicate trial. Used for UI display of trial mode Intersight tiers.* `IWOTrial` - Virtual dummy license type to indicate trial. Used for UI display of trial mode IKS tiers.* `IKSTrial` - Virtual dummy license type to indicate trial. Used for UI display of trial mode IWO tiers.* `INCTrial` - Virtual dummy license type to indicate trial. Used for UI display of trial mode Nexus tiers. 
* `max_task_count`:(int) The maximum number of tasks that can be executed on this workflow. 
* `max_worker_task_count`:(int) The maximum number of external (worker) tasks that can be executed on this workflow. 
* `mod_time`:(string) The time when this managed object was last modified. 
* `mod_user`:(string) The user identifier who last updated the workflow definition. 
* `moid`:(string) The unique identifier of this Managed Object instance. 
* `name`:(string) The name for this workflow. You can have multiple versions of the workflow with the same name. Name can only contain letters (a-z, A-Z), numbers (0-9), hyphen (-), period (.) or an underscore (_). 
* `shared_scope`:(string) Intersight provides pre-built workflows, tasks and policies to end users through global catalogs.Objects that are made available through global catalogs are said to have a 'shared' ownership. Shared objects are either made globally available to all end users or restricted to end users based on their license entitlement. Users can use this property to differentiate the scope (global or a specific license tier) to which a shared MO belongs. 
* `nr_version`:(int) The version of the workflow to support multiple versions.
