# Data Source: intersight_thermal_policy_inventory
Thermal Management policy models a configuration that can be applied to Chassis or Server to manage Thermal Features.
## Argument Reference
The results of this data source are stored in `results` property.
All objects matching the filter criteria are fetched through pagination.
To access the ith object of the results obtained, use `data.intersight_thermal_policy_inventory.<custom_name>.results[i].<propertyname>`.
The following arguments can be used to get data of already created objects in Intersight appliance:
* `account_moid`:(string) The Account ID for this managed object. 
* `aggressive_cooling`:(string) Sets the Aggressive Cooling to Enable/Disable.* `Disabled` - Set the value to Disabled.* `Enabled` - Set the value to Enabled. 
* `create_time`:(string) The time when this managed object was created. 
* `description`:(string) Description of the policy. 
* `device_mo_id`:(string) Device ID of the entity from where inventory is reported. 
* `domain_group_moid`:(string) The DomainGroup ID for this managed object. 
* `fan_control_mode`:(string) Sets the Fan Control Mode. High Power, Maximum Power and Acoustic modes are supported only on the Cisco UCS C-Series servers and on the X-Series Chassis.* `Balanced` - The fans run faster when needed based on the heat generated by the server. When possible, the fans returns to the minimum required speed.* `LowPower` - The Fans run at the minimum speed required to keep the server cool.* `HighPower` - The fans are kept at higher speed to emphasizes performance over power consumption. This Mode is only supported for UCS X series Chassis.* `MaximumPower` - The fans are always kept at maximum speed. This option provides the most cooling and consumes the most power. This Mode is only supported for UCS X series Chassis.* `Acoustic` - The fan speed is reduced to reduce noise levels in acoustic-sensitive environments. This Mode is only supported for UCS X series Chassis. 
* `mod_time`:(string) The time when this managed object was last modified. 
* `moid`:(string) The unique identifier of this Managed Object instance. 
* `name`:(string) Name of the inventoried policy object. 
* `shared_scope`:(string) Intersight provides pre-built workflows, tasks and policies to end users through global catalogs.Objects that are made available through global catalogs are said to have a 'shared' ownership.
