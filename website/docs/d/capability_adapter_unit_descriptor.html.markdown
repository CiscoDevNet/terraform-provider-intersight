# Data Source: intersight_capability_adapter_unit_descriptor
Descriptor that uniquely identifies an adapter.
## Argument Reference
The results of this data source are stored in `results` property.
All objects matching the filter criteria are fetched through pagination.
To access the ith object of the results obtained, use `data.intersight_capability_adapter_unit_descriptor.<custom_name>.results[i].<propertyname>`.
The following arguments can be used to get data of already created objects in Intersight appliance:
* `account_moid`:(string) The Account ID for this managed object. 
* `adapter_generation`:(int) Generation of the adapter.* `4` - Fourth generation adapters (14xx). The PIDs of these adapters end with the string 04.* `2` - Second generation VIC adapters (12xx). The PIDs of these adapters end with the string 02.* `3` - Third generation adapters (13xx). The PIDs of these adapters end with the string 03.* `5` - Fifth generation adapters (15xx). The PIDs of these adapters contain the V5 string. 
* `connectivity_order`:(string) Order in which the ports are connected; sequential or cyclic. 
* `create_time`:(string) The time when this managed object was created. 
* `description`:(string) Detailed information about the endpoint. 
* `domain_group_moid`:(string) The DomainGroup ID for this managed object. 
* `ethernet_port_speed`:(int) The port speed for ethernet ports in Mbps. 
* `fibre_channel_port_speed`:(int) The port speed for fibre channel ports in Mbps. 
* `fibre_channel_scsi_ioq_limit`:(int) The number of SCSI I/O Queue resources to allocate. 
* `is_azure_qos_supported`:(bool) Indicates that the Azure Stack Host QoS feature is supported by this adapter.
