# Data Source: intersight_storage_net_app_initiator_group
NetApp Initiator Group specifies host access to LUNs on the storage system.
## Argument Reference
The results of this data source are stored in `results` property.
All objects matching the filter criteria are fetched through pagination.
To access the ith object of the results obtained, use `data.intersight_storage_net_app_initiator_group.<custom_name>.results[i].<propertyname>`.
The following arguments can be used to get data of already created objects in Intersight appliance:
* `account_moid`:(string) The Account ID for this managed object. 
* `create_time`:(string) The time when this managed object was created. 
* `description`:(string) Short description about the host. 
* `domain_group_moid`:(string) The DomainGroup ID for this managed object. 
* `mod_time`:(string) The time when this managed object was last modified.

* `os_type`:(string) Operating system running on the host. 
* `protocol`:(string) Initiator group protocol.* `FCP` - Fibre channel initiator type which contains WWN of an HBA on the host.* `iSCSI` - An iSCSI initiator type used by the host.* `mixed` - For systems using both FC and iSCSI connections to the same LUN, create two igroups, one for FC and one for iSCSI. Then map the LUN to both igroups. 
* `shared_scope`:(string) Intersight provides pre-built workflows, tasks and policies to end users through global catalogs.Objects that are made available through global catalogs are said to have a 'shared' ownership. Shared objects are either made globally available to all end users or restricted to end users based on their license entitlement.

* `svm_name`:(string) The storage virtual machine name for the initiator group. 
* `uuid`:(string) Universally unique identifier of the LUN.
