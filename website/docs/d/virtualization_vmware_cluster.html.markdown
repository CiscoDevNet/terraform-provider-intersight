# Data Source: intersight_virtualization_vmware_cluster
A real cluster of resources within a data center in VMware. A cluster is a convenient grouping of resources such as Host, Datastore, etc.
## Argument Reference
The results of this data source are stored in `results` property.
All objects matching the filter criteria are fetched through pagination.
To access the ith object of the results obtained, use `data.intersight_virtualization_vmware_cluster.<custom_name>.results[i].<propertyname>`.
The following arguments can be used to get data of already created objects in Intersight appliance:
* `account_moid`:(string) The Account ID for this managed object. 
* `cpu_over_commitment`:(int) CPU over commitment associated with this cluster. 
* `create_time`:(string) The time when this managed object was created. 
* `datastore_count`:(int) Count of all datastores associated with this cluster. 
* `domain_group_moid`:(string) The DomainGroup ID for this managed object. 
* `hypervisor_type`:(string) Identifies the broad type of the underlying hypervisor.* `ESXi` - The hypervisor running on the HyperFlex cluster is a Vmware ESXi hypervisor of any version.* `Hyper-V` - The hypervisor running on the HyperFlex cluster is Microsoft Hyper-V.* `Unknown` - The hypervisor running on the HyperFlex cluster is not known. 
* `hypervisor_version`:(string) Identifies the version of the hypervisor running on this cluster. Keeping the hypervisor version in the cluster makes it convenient for applications to validate their deployment needs. Defaults to an empty string. 
* `identity`:(string) The internally generated identity of this cluster. This entity is not manipulated by users. 
* `inventory_path`:(string) Inventory path of the cluster. 
* `mod_time`:(string) The time when this managed object was last modified. 
* `moid`:(string) The unique identifier of this Managed Object instance. 
* `name`:(string) The user-provided name for this cluster to facilitate identification. 
* `proactive_ha_enabled`:(bool) Every cluster has an option to enable proactive HA in vCenter. Set to true when the vCenter admin has enabled proactive HA for the cluster. 
* `shared_scope`:(string) Intersight provides pre-built workflows, tasks and policies to end users through global catalogs.Objects that are made available through global catalogs are said to have a 'shared' ownership. Shared objects are either made globally available to all end users or restricted to end users based on their license entitlement. Users can use this property to differentiate the scope (global or a specific license tier) to which a shared MO belongs. 
* `status`:(string) Cluster health status as reported by the hypervisor platform.* `Unknown` - Entity status is unknown.* `Degraded` - State is degraded, and might impact normal operation of the entity.* `Critical` - Entity is in a critical state, impacting operations.* `Ok` - Entity status is in a stable state, operating normally. 
* `total_cores`:(int) Total number of CPU cores in this cluster. It is a cumulative number across all hosts in the cluster.
