# Data Source: intersight_storage_storage_policy
The storage policy models the reusable storage related configuration that can be applied on many servers. This policy allows creation of RAID groups using existing disk group policies and virtual drives on the drive groups. The user has options to move all unused disks to JBOD or Unconfigured good state. The security of drives can be enabled through this policy using remote keys from a KMIP server or Manually configured keys.
## Argument Reference
The results of this data source are stored in `results` property.
All objects matching the filter criteria are fetched through pagination.
To access the ith object of the results obtained, use `data.intersight_storage_storage_policy.<custom_name>.results[i].<propertyname>`.
The following arguments can be used to get data of already created objects in Intersight appliance:
* `account_moid`:(string) The Account ID for this managed object. 
* `create_time`:(string) The time when this managed object was created. 
* `default_drive_mode`:(string) All unconfigured drives will move to the selected state on deployment. Newly inserted drives will move to the selected state. Select Unconfigured Good option to retain the existing configuration. Select JBOD to move the unconfigured drives to JBOD state. Select RAID0 to create a RAID0 virtual drive on each of the unconfigured drives. If JBOD is selected, unconfigured drives will move to JBOD state on host reboot. This setting is applicable only to selected set of controllers on FI attached servers.* `UnconfiguredGood` - Newly inserted drives or on reboot, drives will remain the same state.* `Jbod` - Newly inserted drives or on reboot, drives will automatically move to JBOD state if drive state was UnconfiguredGood.* `RAID0` - Newly inserted drives or on reboot, virtual drives will be created, respective drives will move to Online state. 
* `description`:(string) Description of the policy. 
* `direct_attached_nvme_slots`:(string) Only U.3 NVMe drives has to be specified, entered slots will be moved to Direct attached mode. Allowed slots are 1-4, 101-104. Allowed value is a comma or hyphen separated number range. 
* `domain_group_moid`:(string) The DomainGroup ID for this managed object. 
* `global_hot_spares`:(string) A collection of disks that is to be used as hot spares, globally, for all the RAID groups. Allowed value is a number range separated by a comma or a hyphen. 
* `mod_time`:(string) The time when this managed object was last modified. 
* `moid`:(string) The unique identifier of this Managed Object instance. 
* `name`:(string) Name of the concrete policy. 
* `raid_attached_nvme_slots`:(string) Only U.3 NVMe drives has to be specified, entered slots will be moved to RAID attached mode. Allowed slots are 1-4, 101-104. Allowed value is a comma or hyphen separated number range. 
* `secure_jbods`:(string) JBOD drives specified in this slot range will be encrypted. Allowed values are 'ALL', or a comma or hyphen separated number range. Sample format is ALL or 1, 3 or 4-6, 8. Setting the value to 'ALL' will encrypt all the unused UnconfigureGood/JBOD disks. 
* `shared_scope`:(string) Intersight provides pre-built workflows, tasks and policies to end users through global catalogs.Objects that are made available through global catalogs are said to have a 'shared' ownership. Shared objects are either made globally available to all end users or restricted to end users based on their license entitlement. Users can use this property to differentiate the scope (global or a specific license tier) to which a shared MO belongs. 
* `unused_disks_state`:(string) State to which drives, not used in this policy, are to be moved. NoChange will not change the drive state. No Change must be selected if Default Drive State is set to JBOD or RAID0.* `NoChange` - Drive state will not be modified by Storage Policy.* `UnconfiguredGood` - Unconfigured good state -ready to be added in a RAID group.* `Jbod` - JBOD state where the disks start showing up to Host OS. 
* `use_jbod_for_vd_creation`:(bool) Disks in JBOD State are used to create virtual drives. This setting must be disabled if Default Drive State is set to JBOD.
