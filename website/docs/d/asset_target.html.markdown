# Data Source: intersight_asset_target
Target represents an entity which can be managed by Intersight. This includes physical entities like UCS and HyperFlex servers and software entities like VMware vCenter and Microsoft Azure cloud accounts.
## Argument Reference
The results of this data source are stored in `results` property.
All objects matching the filter criteria are fetched through pagination.
To access the ith object of the results obtained, use `data.intersight_asset_target.<custom_name>.results[i].<propertyname>`.
The following arguments can be used to get data of already created objects in Intersight appliance:
* `account_moid`:(string) The Account ID for this managed object. 
* `claimed_by_user_name`:(string) The name or email id of the user who claimed the target. 
* `connector_version`:(string) The Device Connector version for target types which are managed by via embedded Device Connector. 
* `create_time`:(string) The time when this managed object was created. 
* `domain_group_moid`:(string) The DomainGroup ID for this managed object. 
* `external_ip_address`:(string) ExternalIpAddress is applicable for targets which are managed via an Intersight Device Connector. The value is the IP Address of the target as seen from Intersight. It is either the IP Address of the managed target's interface which has a route to the internet or a NAT IP Addresss when the target is deployed in a private network. 
* `management_location`:(string) The location from which Intersight manages the target.* `Unknown` - The management mechanism is not detected. Unknown is used as a default by the implementation and is not an allowed user input.* `Intersight` - Management of a target is performed directly from Intersight. Network connections are established from Intersight to a management interface of the Target and authenticated using user provided credentials.* `IntersightAssist` - Management of a target is performed via a selected Intersight Assist. Network connections are established from the Intersight Assist to a management interface of the Target.* `DeviceConnector` - An Intersight Device Connector running within the Target establishes a connection to Intersight and management of the target is performed via this connection. 
* `mod_time`:(string) The time when this managed object was last modified. 
* `moid`:(string) The unique identifier of this Managed Object instance. 
* `name`:(string) A user provided name for the managed target. 
* `read_only`:(bool) For targets which are managed by an embedded Intersight Device Connector, this field indicates that an administrator of the target has disabled management operations of the Device Connector and only monitoring is permitted. 
* `shared_scope`:(string) Intersight provides pre-built workflows, tasks and policies to end users through global catalogs.Objects that are made available through global catalogs are said to have a 'shared' ownership. Shared objects are either made globally available to all end users or restricted to end users based on their license entitlement. Users can use this property to differentiate the scope (global or a specific license tier) to which a shared MO belongs. 
* `status`:(string) Status indicates if Intersight can establish a connection and authenticate with the managed target. Status does not include information about the functional health of the target.* `` - The target details have been persisted but Intersight has not yet attempted to connect to the target.* `Connected` - Intersight is able to establish a connection to the target and initiate management activities.* `NotConnected` - Intersight is unable to establish a connection to the target.* `ClaimInProgress` - Claim of the target is in progress. A connection to the target has not been fully established.* `Unclaimed` - The device was un-claimed from the users account by an Administrator of the device. Also indicates the failure to claim Targets of type HTTP Endpoint in Intersight.* `Claimed` - Target of type HTTP Endpoint is successfully claimed in Intersight. Currently no validation is performed to verify the Target connectivity from Intersight at the time of creation. However invoking API from Intersight Orchestrator fails if this Target is not reachable from Intersight or if Target API credentials are incorrect. 
* `status_error_reason`:(string) StatusErrorReason provides additional context for the Status. 
* `target_type`:(string) The type of the managed target. For example a UCS Server or VMware Vcenter target.* `` - The device reported an empty or unrecognized platform type.* `APIC` - An Application Policy Infrastructure Controller cluster.* `DCNM` - A Data Center Network Manager instance. Data Center Network Manager (DCNM) is the network management platform for all NX-OS-enabled deployments, spanning new fabric architectures, IP Fabric for Media, and storage networking deployments for the Cisco Nexus-powered data center.* `UCSFI` - A UCS Fabric Interconnect in HA or standalone mode, which is being managed by UCS Manager (UCSM).* `UCSFIISM` - A UCS Fabric Interconnect in HA or standalone mode, managed directly by Intersight.* `IMC` - A standalone UCS Server Integrated Management Controller.* `IMCM4` - A standalone UCS M4 Server.* `IMCM5` - A standalone UCS M5 server.* `IMCRack` - A standalone UCS M6 and above server.* `UCSIOM` - An UCS Chassis IO module.* `HX` - A HyperFlex storage controller.* `HyperFlexAP` - A HyperFlex Application Platform.* `IWE` - An Intersight Workload Engine.* `UCSD` - A UCS Director virtual appliance.
