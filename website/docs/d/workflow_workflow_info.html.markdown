# Data Source: intersight_workflow_workflow_info
Contains information for a workflow which is an execution instance of the workflow definition given in the relationship. The workflow definition will provide the schema of the inputs taken to start the workflow execution and the schema of the outputs generated at the end of successful workflow execution. The sequence of tasks to be executed is also provided in the workflow definition. For a workflow to successfully start execution the following properties must be provided- Name, AssociatedObject that carries the relationship to Organization under which the workflow must be executed, WorkflowDefinition, and Inputs with all the required data in order to start workflow execution.
## Argument Reference
The results of this data source are stored in `results` property.
All objects matching the filter criteria are fetched through pagination.
To access the ith object of the results obtained, use `data.intersight_workflow_workflow_info.<custom_name>.results[i].<propertyname>`.
The following arguments can be used to get data of already created objects in Intersight appliance:
* `account_moid`:(string) The Account ID for this managed object. 
* `action`:(string) The action of the workflow such as start, cancel, retry, pause.* `None` - No action is set, this is the default value for action field.* `Create` - Create a new instance of the workflow but it does not start the execution of the workflow. Use the Start action to start execution of the workflow.* `Start` - Start a new execution of the workflow.* `Pause` - Pause the workflow, this can only be issued on workflows that are in running state. A workflow can be paused for a maximum of 180 days, after 180 days the workflow will be terminated by the system.* `Resume` - Resume the workflow which was previously paused through pause action on the workflow.* `Rerun` - Rerun the workflow that has previously reached a failed state. The workflow is run from the beginning using inputs from previous execution. Completed and currently running workflows cannot be rerun. Workflows do not have to be marked for retry to use this action.* `Retry` - This action has been deprecated. Please use RetryFailed, Rerun or RetryFromTask action. Retry the workflow that has previously reached a final state and has the retryable property set to true. A running or waiting workflow cannot be retried. If the property retryFromTaskName is also passed along with this action, the workflow will be started from that specific task, otherwise the workflow will be restarted from the first task.  The task name in retryFromTaskName must be one of the tasks that completed or failed in the previous run. It is not possible to retry a workflow from a task which wasn't run in the previous iteration.* `RetryFailed` - Retry the workflow that has failed. A running or waiting workflow or a workflow that completed successfully cannot be retried. Only the tasks that failed in the previous run will be retried and the rest of workflow will be run. This action does not restart the workflow and also does not support retrying from a specific task.* `RetryFromTask` - Retry the workflow that has previously reached a failed state and has the retryable property set to true. A running or waiting workflow cannot be retried. RetryFromTaskName must be passed along with this action, and the workflow will be started from that specific task. The task name in RetryFromTaskName must be one of the tasks that was executed in the previous attempt. It is not possible to retry a workflow from a task that wasn't run in the previous execution attempt.* `Cancel` - Cancel the workflow that is in running or waiting state. 
* `cleanup_time`:(string) The time when the workflow info will be removed from the database. When WorkflowInfo is created, cleanup time will be set to 181 days. As the workflow progresses through different states the cleanup time can be updated. A cleanup time of 0 means the workflow is not scheduled for cleanup. An active workflow that continues to schedule & run tasks can run for any amount of time and there is no upper bound for such workflows. Workflows that are not actively running, say in Paused or Waiting states will be removed after 181 days. 
* `create_time`:(string) The time when this managed object was created. 
* `domain_group_moid`:(string) The DomainGroup ID for this managed object. 
* `email`:(string) The email address of the user who started this workflow. 
* `end_time`:(string) The time when the workflow reached a final state. 
* `failed_workflow_cleanup_duration`:(int) The duration in hours after which the workflow info for failed, terminated or timed out workflow will be removed from database. The minimum is 1 hour, maximum is 365 days and default is 90 days. 
* `inst_id`:(string) A workflow instance Id which is the unique identified for the workflow execution. 
* `internal`:(bool) Denotes that an Intersight service started this workflow as internal and hence will not be shown in Intersight User Interface. Typically these are internal system maintenance workflows which are triggered by Intersight services. 
* `last_action`:(string) The last action that was issued on the workflow is saved in this field.* `None` - No action is set, this is the default value for action field.* `Create` - Create a new instance of the workflow but it does not start the execution of the workflow. Use the Start action to start execution of the workflow.* `Start` - Start a new execution of the workflow.* `Pause` - Pause the workflow, this can only be issued on workflows that are in running state. A workflow can be paused for a maximum of 180 days, after 180 days the workflow will be terminated by the system.* `Resume` - Resume the workflow which was previously paused through pause action on the workflow.* `Rerun` - Rerun the workflow that has previously reached a failed state. The workflow is run from the beginning using inputs from previous execution. Completed and currently running workflows cannot be rerun. Workflows do not have to be marked for retry to use this action.* `Retry` - This action has been deprecated. Please use RetryFailed, Rerun or RetryFromTask action. Retry the workflow that has previously reached a final state and has the retryable property set to true. A running or waiting workflow cannot be retried. If the property retryFromTaskName is also passed along with this action, the workflow will be started from that specific task, otherwise the workflow will be restarted from the first task.  The task name in retryFromTaskName must be one of the tasks that completed or failed in the previous run. It is not possible to retry a workflow from a task which wasn't run in the previous iteration.* `RetryFailed` - Retry the workflow that has failed. A running or waiting workflow or a workflow that completed successfully cannot be retried. Only the tasks that failed in the previous run will be retried and the rest of workflow will be run. This action does not restart the workflow and also does not support retrying from a specific task.* `RetryFromTask` - Retry the workflow that has previously reached a failed state and has the retryable property set to true. A running or waiting workflow cannot be retried. RetryFromTaskName must be passed along with this action, and the workflow will be started from that specific task. The task name in RetryFromTaskName must be one of the tasks that was executed in the previous attempt. It is not possible to retry a workflow from a task that wasn't run in the previous execution attempt.* `Cancel` - Cancel the workflow that is in running or waiting state. 
* `mod_time`:(string) The time when this managed object was last modified. 
* `moid`:(string) The unique identifier of this Managed Object instance. 
* `name`:(string) A name of the workflow execution instance. 
* `pause_reason`:(string) Denotes the reason workflow is in paused status.* `None` - Pause reason is none, which indicates there is no reason for the pause state.* `TaskWithWarning` - Pause reason indicates the workflow is in this state due to a task that has a status as completed with warnings.* `SystemMaintenance` - Pause reason indicates the workflow is in this state based on actions of system admin for maintenance. 
* `progress`:(float) This field indicates percentage of workflow task completion based on the total number of tasks in the workflow. The total number of tasks in the workflow is calculated based on the longest path the workflow execution can take. So progress is calculated based on the percentage of tasks that completed out of the total number of tasks that could be executed. Progress is not a representation of the time taken to complete the workflow. A task is considered as completed if the task status is either \ NO_OP\  or \ COMPLETED\ . If the task status is \ SKIP_TO_FAIL\ , the workflow will be terminated and the progress of the workflow will be set to 100. 
* `retry_from_task_name`:(string) This field is required when RetryFromTask action is issued for a workflow that is in a 'final' state. The workflow will be retried from the specified task. This field must specify a task name which is the unique name of the task within the workflow. The task name must be one of the tasks that were completed or failed in the previous run. It is not possible to retry a workflow from a task that wasn't run in the previous execution attempt. 
* `shared_scope`:(string) Intersight provides pre-built workflows, tasks and policies to end users through global catalogs.Objects that are made available through global catalogs are said to have a 'shared' ownership. Shared objects are either made globally available to all end users or restricted to end users based on their license entitlement. Users can use this property to differentiate the scope (global or a specific license tier) to which a shared MO belongs. 
* `src`:(string) The source service that started the workflow execution and hence represents the owning service for this workflow. 
* `start_time`:(string) The time when the workflow was started for execution. 
* `status`:(string) A status of the workflow (RUNNING, WAITING, COMPLETED, TIME_OUT, FAILED). 
* `success_workflow_cleanup_duration`:(int) The duration in hours after which the workflow info for successful workflow will be removed from database. The minimum is 1 hour, maximum is 365 days and default is 90 days. 
* `trace_id`:(string) The trace id to keep track of workflow execution. 
* `type`:(string) A type of the workflow (serverconfig, ansible_monitoring). 
* `user_action_required`:(bool) Property will be set when a user action is required on the workflow. This can be because the workflow is waiting for a wait task to be updated, workflow is paused or workflow launched by a configuration object has failed and needs to be retried in order to complete successfully. 
* `user_id`:(string) The user identifier which indicates the user that started this workflow. 
* `wait_reason`:(string) Denotes the reason workflow is in waiting status.* `None` - Wait reason is none, which indicates there is no reason for the waiting state.* `GatherTasks` - Wait reason is gathering tasks, which indicates the workflow is in this state in order to gather tasks.* `Duplicate` - Wait reason is duplicate, which indicates the workflow is a duplicate of current running workflow.* `RateLimit` - Wait reason is rate limit, which indicates the workflow is rate limited by account/instance level throttling threshold.* `WaitTask` - Wait reason when there are one or more wait tasks in the workflow which are yet to receive a task status update.* `PendingRetryFailed` - Wait reason when the workflow is pending a RetryFailed action.* `WaitingToStart` - Workflow is waiting to start on workflow engine.
