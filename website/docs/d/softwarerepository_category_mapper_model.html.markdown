# Data Source: intersight_softwarerepository_category_mapper_model
Maps a Cisco hardware model Series to its applicable hardware models.
## Argument Reference
The results of this data source are stored in `results` property.
All objects matching the filter criteria are fetched through pagination.
To access the ith object of the results obtained, use `data.intersight_softwarerepository_category_mapper_model.<custom_name>.results[i].<propertyname>`.
