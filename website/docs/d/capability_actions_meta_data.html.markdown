# Data Source: intersight_capability_actions_meta_data
Metadata or constraints of various server actions supported in Intersight for 3rd Party servers. It is validated against the target provided  and the actions are allowed only upon successful validation.
## Argument Reference
The results of this data source are stored in `results` property.
All objects matching the filter criteria are fetched through pagination.
To access the ith object of the results obtained, use `data.intersight_capability_actions_meta_data.<custom_name>.results[i].<propertyname>`.
The following arguments can be used to get data of already created objects in Intersight appliance:
* `account_moid`:(string) The Account ID for this managed object. 
* `create_time`:(string) The time when this managed object was created. 
* `domain_group_moid`:(string) The DomainGroup ID for this managed object.
