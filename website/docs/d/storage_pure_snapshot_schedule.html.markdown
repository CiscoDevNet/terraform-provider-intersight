# Data Source: intersight_storage_pure_snapshot_schedule
PureStorage FlashArray snapshot schedule configuration entity.
## Argument Reference
The results of this data source are stored in `results` property.
All objects matching the filter criteria are fetched through pagination.
To access the ith object of the results obtained, use `data.intersight_storage_pure_snapshot_schedule.<custom_name>.results[i].<propertyname>`.
The following arguments can be used to get data of already created objects in Intersight appliance:
* `account_moid`:(string) The Account ID for this managed object. 
* `create_time`:(string) The time when this managed object was created. 
* `daily_limit`:(int) Total number of snapshots per day to be available on source above and over the specified retention time. PureStorage FlashArray maintains all created snapshot until retention period. Daily limit is applied only on the snapshots once retention time is expired. In case of, daily limit is less than the number of snapshot available on source, system select snapshots evenly spaced out throughout the day. 
* `domain_group_moid`:(string) The DomainGroup ID for this managed object. 
* `frequency`:(string) Snapshot frequency. It is an interval at which snapshot is set to trigger on source array.Examples:    PT2H Snapshot is generated every 2 hours.    P4D, Snapshot is scheduled for every 4 days.    PT2H34M56.123S is 2 hours, 34 minutes, 56 seconds and 123 milliseconds. 
* `mod_time`:(string) The time when this managed object was last modified. 
* `moid`:(string) The unique identifier of this Managed Object instance. 
* `name`:(string) Name of the snapshot schedule. 
* `retention_time`:(string) Duration to keep the snapshots on the source array.Once this period expires, system deletes the snapshot automatically from the source array.Examples:P200D,  200 days.PT2H34M56.123S, 2 hours, 34 minutes, 56 seconds and 123 milliseconds. 
* `shared_scope`:(string) Intersight provides pre-built workflows, tasks and policies to end users through global catalogs.Objects that are made available through global catalogs are said to have a 'shared' ownership.

Users can use this property to differentiate the scope (global or a specific license tier) to which a shared MO belongs. 
* `snapshot_expiry_time`:(string) Duration to keep the daily limit snapshots on source array. StorageArray deletes the snapshots permanently from source beyond this period. 
* `snapshot_time`:(string) Preferred time of the day to capture the snapshot. It is applicable only if the frequency is set for a day or more.Format: hh:mm:ssExample: 08:30:00, Snapshot is set for 08:30 AM.
