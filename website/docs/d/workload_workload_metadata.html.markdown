        ### Overview
        The WorkloadMetadata holds version agnostic information about a workload definition. It serves as a statistical summary and aggregation container for workload definitions. WorkloadMetadata provides a centralized view of deployment states and conformance status across all deployments associated with a specific workload definition.
        #### Purpose
        WorkloadMetadata exists to provide efficient access to aggregated metrics and state information for workload definitions without requiring clients to query and aggregate data from individual deployments. This improves performance and provides a consistent view of workload health across the organization.
        #### Key Concepts
        - **Deployment Summary Aggregation:** - Maintains real-time aggregated counts of deployment states across all workload deployments associated with the definition.
        - **Conformance Summary Aggregation:** - Tracks conformance states across deployments, helping administrators understand compliance and drift status at the workload definition level.
        - **Read-Only Reference Data:** - All properties are read-only, as this object serves as a computed aggregation maintained automatically by the system.

## Argument Reference
The results of this data source are stored in `results` property.
All objects matching the filter criteria are fetched through pagination.
To access the ith object of the results obtained, use `data.intersight_workload_workload_metadata.<custom_name>.results[i].<propertyname>`.
The following arguments can be used to get data of already created objects in Intersight appliance:
* `account_moid`:(string) The Account ID for this managed object. 
* `create_time`:(string) The time when this managed object was created. 
* `domain_group_moid`:(string) The DomainGroup ID for this managed object. 
* `mod_time`:(string) The time when this managed object was last modified. 
* `moid`:(string) The unique identifier of this Managed Object instance. 
* `shared_scope`:(string) Intersight provides pre-built workflows, tasks and policies to end users through global catalogs.Objects that are made available through global catalogs are said to have a 'shared' ownership. Shared objects are either made globally available to all end users or restricted to end users based on their license entitlement. Users can use this property to differentiate the scope (global or a specific license tier) to which a shared MO belongs. 
* `workload_ref_name`:(string) Reference name for the workload, generated by the system and used internally for identification.
