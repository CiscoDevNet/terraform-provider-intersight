# Data Source: intersight_memory_persistent_memory_region
Persistent Memory Region configured on the Persistent Memory Modules on a server.
## Argument Reference
The results of this data source are stored in `results` property.
All objects matching the filter criteria are fetched through pagination.
To access the ith object of the results obtained, use `data.intersight_memory_persistent_memory_region.<custom_name>.results[i].<propertyname>`.
The following arguments can be used to get data of already created objects in Intersight appliance:
* `account_moid`:(string) The Account ID for this managed object. 
* `create_time`:(string) The time when this managed object was created. 
* `device_mo_id`:(string) The database identifier of the registered device of an object. 
* `dn`:(string) The Distinguished Name unambiguously identifies an object in the system. 
* `domain_group_moid`:(string) The DomainGroup ID for this managed object. 
* `free_capacity`:(string) Free capacity in GiB of the Persistent Memory Region. 
* `health_state`:(string) Health state of the Persistent Memory Region. 
* `interleaved_set_id`:(string) ID of the Interleaved Set formed for this Persistent Memory Region. 
* `locater_ids`:(string) Set of locator IDs that are included in the Persistent Memory Region. 
* `mod_time`:(string) The time when this managed object was last modified.

Users can use this property to differentiate the scope (global or a specific license tier) to which a shared MO belongs. 
* `socket_id`:(string) Socket ID of the Persistent Memory Region. 
* `socket_memory_id`:(string) Socket Memory ID of the Persistent Memory Region. 
* `total_capacity`:(string) Total capacity in GiB of the Persistent Memory Region.
