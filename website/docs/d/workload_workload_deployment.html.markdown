# Data Source: intersight_workload_workload_deployment
A deployment for a workload definition within an Organization. All resources which match the qualification criteria given in Workload and deployment will be configured through this Workload Deployment.
## Argument Reference
The results of this data source are stored in `results` property.
All objects matching the filter criteria are fetched through pagination.
To access the ith object of the results obtained, use `data.intersight_workload_workload_deployment.<custom_name>.results[i].<propertyname>`.
The following arguments can be used to get data of already created objects in Intersight appliance:
* `account_moid`:(string) The Account ID for this managed object. 
* `action`:(string) The action is performed on the deployment.* `None` - No changes have been made.* `PrepareToDeploy` - Marks the deployment as ready once the user has completed all changes and the deployment is in a valid state. Once the deployment is marked as PrepareToDeploy, workload instances will be created, but the actual deployment will occur as part of the deploy action.* `Deploy` - Initiates the process of pushing workload configuration to the instances based on the configured schedule. Once deployed, the deployment cannot be reverted to draft status.* `Suspend` - Suspends the deployment, preventing any further actions until it is resumed. Making changes to deployment configuration will not be pushed out. The deployment will not take any changes from the attached Workload when it is suspended.* `Retry` - Retries the deployment for all instances that previously failed.* `Resume` - Resumes a suspended deployment. Any changes made to the deployment when it was suspended or any changes made to the attached Workload will now be pushed out based on configured schedules. 
* `conformance`:(string) The conformance status of the deployment.* `Ok` - The deployment conforms to the preferred version of the workload.* `NonConformant` - The deployment does not conform to the preferred version of the workload. 
* `create_time`:(string) The time when this managed object was created. 
* `description`:(string) A brief description of the deployment. 
* `digit_count`:(int) The minimum digit count to format the instance index with leading zeros,  for example if the digit count is 4 and the start index is 1, then the  first instance will have a suffix 0001. If the number of instances created for the deployment exceeds the 9999, then the suffix will become a 5 digit number. 
* `domain_group_moid`:(string) The DomainGroup ID for this managed object. 
* `last_action`:(string) The last action is performed on the deployment.* `None` - No changes have been made.* `PrepareToDeploy` - Marks the deployment as ready once the user has completed all changes and the deployment is in a valid state. Once the deployment is marked as PrepareToDeploy, workload instances will be created, but the actual deployment will occur as part of the deploy action.* `Deploy` - Initiates the process of pushing workload configuration to the instances based on the configured schedule. Once deployed, the deployment cannot be reverted to draft status.* `Suspend` - Suspends the deployment, preventing any further actions until it is resumed. Making changes to deployment configuration will not be pushed out. The deployment will not take any changes from the attached Workload when it is suspended.* `Retry` - Retries the deployment for all instances that previously failed.* `Resume` - Resumes a suspended deployment. Any changes made to the deployment when it was suspended or any changes made to the attached Workload will now be pushed out based on configured schedules. 
* `last_instance_index`:(int) Tracks the last numeric index used for workload instances. The next instance index is derived by incrementing this value. 
* `mod_time`:(string) The time when this managed object was last modified. 
* `moid`:(string) The unique identifier of this Managed Object instance. 
* `name`:(string) The name for this Deployment. Name can only contain letters (a-z, A-Z), numbers (0-9), space, hyphen (-), or an underscore (_). The name must be unique within the organization. 
* `ref_name`:(string) A reference name is generated by the system based on the given name by replacing spaces and hyphen in name with underscore. This reference name is used internally and cannot be edited by users. It may only contain letters (a–z, A–Z), numbers (0–9), and underscores (_). 
* `shared_scope`:(string) Intersight provides pre-built workflows, tasks and policies to end users through global catalogs.Objects that are made available through global catalogs are said to have a 'shared' ownership. Shared objects are either made globally available to all end users or restricted to end users based on their license entitlement. Users can use this property to differentiate the scope (global or a specific license tier) to which a shared MO belongs. 
* `start_index_for_suffix`:(int) The starting index used to generate the suffix for the workload instance name. 
* `status`:(string) The status of the deployment.* `Draft` - The initial state of the deployment, indicating it is still being configured and not ready for deployment.* `ReadyToDeploy` - The deployment has passed validation checks and is ready to be deployed to instances.* `InProgress` - The initial deployment or changes in the deployment are in progress.* `Ok` - All associated instances have been successfully deployed.* `Failed` - One or more instances failed during initial deployment or changes in the deployment operations.* `ChangesScheduled` - The deployment has changes that need to be pushed to all associated instances.* `Suspended` - The deployment is suspended, preventing any further initial deployments or changes to deployment operations. 
* `workload_instance_prefix`:(string) The prefix to be used for naming workload instances created by this deployment. Prefix can only contain letters (a-z, A-Z), numbers (0-9), hyphen (-), or an underscore (_). This prefix must be unique within the organization.
