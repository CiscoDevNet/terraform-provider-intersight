## Argument Reference
The results of this data source are stored in `results` property.
All objects matching the filter criteria are fetched through pagination.

* `account_moid`:(string) The Account ID for this managed object. 
* `admin_evac_state`:(string) Sets evacuation state of the switch. When evacuation is enabled, data traffic flowing through this switch will be suspended for all the servers.

* `admin_locator_led_action_state`:(string) Defines status of action performed on AdminLocatorLedState.* `None` - Nil value when no action has been triggered by the user.* `Applied` - User configured settings are in applied state.* `Applying` - User settings are being applied on the target server.* `Failed` - User configured settings could not be applied. 
* `config_evac_state`:(string) Captures the status of evacuation on this switch.* `None` - Nil value when no action has been triggered by the user.* `Applied` - User configured settings are in applied state.* `Applying` - User settings are being applied on the target server.* `Failed` - User configured settings could not be applied. 
* `create_time`:(string) The time when this managed object was created. 
* `domain_group_moid`:(string) The DomainGroup ID for this managed object.
