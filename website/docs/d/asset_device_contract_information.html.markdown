  Contains information about the Cisco device identified by a unique identifier like serial number. It also contains information about warranty, contract status, validity of the device. In future this object could be expanded to store Case, RMA, device topology details. We observe new asset.DeviceRegisteration and use it as a trigger for creating an instance of this object.

# Data Source: intersight_asset_device_contract_information
Contains information about the Cisco device identified by a unique identifier like serial number. It also contains information about warranty, contract status, validity of the device. In future this object could be expanded to store Case, RMA, device topology details. We observe new asset.DeviceRegisteration and use it as a trigger for creating an instance of this object. Currently the data is restricted to Cisco Standalone IMC servers and Fabric Interconnects. Support for more product lines will be added in future.
## Argument Reference
The following arguments can be used to get data of already created objects in Intersight appliance:
* `contract_status`:(string) Calculated contract status that is derived based on the service line status and contract end date. It is different from serviceLineStatus property. serviceLineStatus gives us ACTIVE, OVERDUE, EXPIRED. These are transformed into Active, Expiring Soon and Not Covered.* `Unknown` - The device's contract status cannot be determined.* `Not Covered` - The Cisco device does not have a valid support contract.* `Active` - The Cisco device is covered under a active support contract.* `Expiring Soon` - The contract for this Cisco device is going to expire in the next 30 days.
