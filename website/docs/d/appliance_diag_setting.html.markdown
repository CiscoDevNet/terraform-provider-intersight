        DiagSetting model is used for changing the password of the operating system's diagnostic
        user account. The diagnostic user account can be used to login to the Intersight Appliance
        virtual machine.
        The diagnostic user account is protected by two separate authentication mechanisms: user's
        password and Cisco CT-engine generated key. Only the Intersight Appliance's local account
        administrator has the privileges to use this REST API.
