# Data Source: intersight_vnic_fc_veth_inventory
A Fibre Channel Quality of Service (QoS) policy assigns a system class to the outgoing traffic for a vHBA. This system class determines the quality of service for the outgoing traffic. For certain adapters additional controls can also be specified like burst and rate on the outgoing traffic.
## Argument Reference
The results of this data source are stored in `results` property.
All objects matching the filter criteria are fetched through pagination.
To access the ith object of the results obtained, use `data.intersight_vnic_fc_veth_inventory.<custom_name>.results[i].<propertyname>`.
The following arguments can be used to get data of already created objects in Intersight appliance:
* `account_moid`:(string) The Account ID for this managed object. 
* `burst`:(int) The burst traffic, in bytes, allowed on the vNIC. 
* `create_time`:(string) The time when this managed object was created.

* `device_mo_id`:(string) Device ID of the entity from where inventory is reported. 
* `domain_group_moid`:(string) The DomainGroup ID for this managed object. 
* `mod_time`:(string) The time when this managed object was last modified. 
* `moid`:(string) The unique identifier of this Managed Object instance. 
* `name`:(string) Name of the virtual FC interface. 
* `rate_limit`:(int) The value in Mbps to use for limiting the data rate on the virtual interface. Setting this to zero will turn rate limiting off. 
* `shared_scope`:(string) Intersight provides pre-built workflows, tasks and policies to end users through global catalogs.Objects that are made available through global catalogs are said to have a 'shared' ownership.
