# Data Source: intersight_compute_server_setting
Models the configurable properties of a server in Intersight.
## Argument Reference
The results of this data source are stored in `results` property.
All objects matching the filter criteria are fetched through pagination.
To access the ith object of the results obtained, use `data.intersight_compute_server_setting.<custom_name>.results[i].<propertyname>`.
The following arguments can be used to get data of already created objects in Intersight appliance:
* `account_moid`:(string) The Account ID for this managed object. 
* `admin_locator_led_state`:(string) User configured state of the locator LED for the server.* `None` - No operation property for locator led.* `On` - The Locator Led is turned on.* `Off` - The Locator Led is turned off. 
* `admin_power_state`:(string) User configured power state of the server.* `Policy` - Power state is set to the default value in the policy.* `PowerOn` - Power state of the server is set to On.* `PowerOff` - Power state is the server set to Off.* `PowerCycle` - Power state the server is reset.* `HardReset` - Power state the server is hard reset.* `Shutdown` - Operating system on the server is shut down.* `Reboot` - Power state of IMC is rebooted. 
* `clear_sel`:(string) Clear system event log on a server.* `Ready` - Clear system event log operation is allowed on the server in this state.* `Clear` - Trigger a clear system event log operation on a server. 
* `cmos_reset`:(string) The allowed actions on the CMOS Reset.* `Ready` - CMOS Reset operation is allowed to be done on the server in this state.* `Pending` - The identifier to state that the previous CMOS Reset operation on this server has not completed due to a pending power cycle. CMOS Reset operation cannot be done on the server when in this state.* `Reset` - The value that the UI/API needs to provide to trigger a CMOS Reset operation on a server. 
* `collect_sel`:(string) Collect system event log from a server.* `Ready` - Collect system event log operation is allowed on the server in this state.* `Collect` - Trigger a collect system event log operation on a server. 
* `config_state`:(string) The configured state of these settings in the target server. The value is any one of Applied, Applying, Failed. Applied - This state denotes that the settings are applied successfully in the target server. Applying - This state denotes that the settings are being applied in the target server. Failed - This state denotes that the settings could not be applied in the target server.* `Applied` - User configured settings are in applied state.* `Applying` - User settings are being applied on the target server.* `Scheduled` - User configured settings are scheduled to be applied.* `Failed` - User configured settings could not be applied. 
* `create_time`:(string) The time when this managed object was created. 
* `device_mo_id`:(string) The database identifier of the registered device of an object. 
* `dn`:(string) The Distinguished Name unambiguously identifies an object in the system. 
* `domain_group_moid`:(string) The DomainGroup ID for this managed object. 
* `front_panel_lock_state`:(string) The allowed actions on the Front Panel Lock.* `None` - Front Panel of the server is set to None state. It is required so that the next frontPanelLockState operation can be triggered.* `Lock` - Front Panel of the server is set to Locked state.* `Unlock` - Front Panel of the server is set to Unlocked state. 
* `host_init_configuration`:(string) The JSON formatted host initialization configuration containing the basic information for doing an initial boot. The information will be sent to CIMC and stored in host-init.json file on the server. The stored file can only be access using IPMI tool on the host OS. 
* `kvm_reset`:(string) The allowed actions on the vKVM Reset.* `Ready` - Reset vKVM operation is allowed to be done on the server in this state.* `Reset` - The value that the UI/API needs to provide to trigger a Reset vKVM operation on a server. 
* `mod_time`:(string) The time when this managed object was last modified. 
* `moid`:(string) The unique identifier of this Managed Object instance. 
* `name`:(string) The property used to identify the name of the server it is associated with. 
* `one_time_boot_device`:(string) The name of the device chosen by user for configuring One-Time Boot device. 
* `reset_memory_errors`:(string) Reset Correctable and Uncorrectable ECC errors on all the DIMMs present in the server.* `Ready` - Reset memory errors operation is allowed on the server in this state.* `Reset` - Trigger reset memory errors operation on a server. 
* `rn`:(string) The Relative Name uniquely identifies an object within a given context. 
* `shared_scope`:(string) Intersight provides pre-built workflows, tasks and policies to end users through global catalogs.Objects that are made available through global catalogs are said to have a 'shared' ownership.

* `tpm_reset`:(string) Clear the configuration of TPM chip in the server.* `None` - Perform no action on the TPM.* `ClearTpm` - Clear the configuration and restore factory defaults of TPM chip in the server. 
* `tunneled_kvm_state`:(string) By default, the tunneled vKVM property appears in Ready state. The property can be configured by performing allowed actions. Once the property is configured, it reverts to Ready state.* `Ready` - Tunneled vKVM is ready to be configured on the server.* `Enable` - Tunneled vKVM is enabled for the server.* `Disable` - Tunneled vKVM is disabled for the server.
