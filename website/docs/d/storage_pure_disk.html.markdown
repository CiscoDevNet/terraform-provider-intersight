# Data Source: intersight_storage._pure_disk
Disk entity associated with Pure FlashArray.
## Argument Reference
The following arguments can be used to get data of already created objects in Intersight appliance:
* `class_id`:(string) The concrete type of this complex type. Its value must be the same as the 'objectType' property.The OpenAPI document references this property as a discriminator value. 
* `device_mo_id`:(string) The database identifier of the registered device of an object. 
* `dn`:(string) The Distinguished Name unambiguously identifies an object in the system. 
* `model`:(string) This field identifies the model of the given component. 
* `moid`:(string) The unique identifier of this Managed Object instance. 
* `name`:(string) Disk name available in storage array. 
* `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified type of this managed object, i.e. the class name.This property is optional. The ObjectType is implied from the URL path.If specified, the value of objectType must match the class name specified in the URL path. 
* `part_number`:(string) Storage disk part number. 
* `protocol`:(string) Storage protocol used in disk for communication. Possible values are SAS, SATA and NVMe.* `Unknown` - Disk protocol is unknown.* `SAS` - Serial Attached SCSI protocol (SAS) used in disk.* `NVMe` - Non-volatile memory express (NVMe) protocol used in disk.* `SATA` - Serial Advanced Technology Attachment (SATA) used in disk. 
* `revision`:(string) This field identifies the revision of the given component. 
* `rn`:(string) The Relative Name uniquely identifies an object within a given context. 
* `serial`:(string) This field identifies the serial of the given component. 
* `speed`:(int) Disk speed for read or write operation measured in rpm. 
* `status`:(string) Storage disk health status.* `Unknown` - Component status is not available.* `Ok` - Component is healthy and no issues found.* `Degraded` - Functioning, but not at full capability due to a non-fatal failure.* `Critical` - Not functioning or requiring immediate attention.* `Offline` - Component is installed, but powered off.* `Identifying` - Component is in initialization process.* `NotAvailable` - Component is not installed or not available.* `Updating` - Software update is in progress.* `Unrecognized` - Component is not recognized. It may be because the component is not installed properly or it is not supported. 
* `type`:(string) Storage disk type - it can be SSD, HDD, NVRAM.* `Unknown` - Default unknown disk type.* `SSD` - Storage disk with Solid state disk.* `HDD` - Storage disk with Hard disk drive.* `NVRAM` - Storage disk with Non-volatile random-access memory type.* `SATA` - Disk drive implementation with Serial Advanced Technology Attachment (SATA).* `BSAS` - Bridged SAS-SATA disks with added hardware to enable them to be plugged into a SAS-connected storage shelf.* `FC` - Storage disk with Fiber Channel.* `FSAS` - Near Line SAS. NL-SAS drives are enterprise SATA drives with a SAS interface, head, media, androtational speed of traditional enterprise-class SATA drives with the fully capable SAS interfacetypical for classic SAS drives.* `LUN` - Logical Unit Number refers to a logical disk.* `MSATA` - SATA disk in multi-disk carrier storage shelf.* `SAS` - Storage disk with serial attached SCSI.* `VMDISK` - Virtual machine Data Disk. 
* `vendor`:(string) This field identifies the vendor of the given component. 
* `version`:(string) Storage disk version number.
