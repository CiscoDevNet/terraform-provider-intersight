# Data Source: intersight_vnic_eth_if
Virtual Ethernet Interface.
## Argument Reference
The results of this data source are stored in `results` property.
All objects matching the filter criteria are fetched through pagination.
To access the ith object of the results obtained, use `data.intersight_vnic_eth_if.<custom_name>.results[i].<propertyname>`.
The following arguments can be used to get data of already created objects in Intersight appliance:
* `account_moid`:(string) The Account ID for this managed object. 
* `create_time`:(string) The time when this managed object was created. 
* `domain_group_moid`:(string) The DomainGroup ID for this managed object. 
* `failover_enabled`:(bool) Enabling failover ensures that traffic from the vNIC automatically fails over to the secondary Fabric Interconnect, in case the specified Fabric Interconnect path goes down. Failover applies only to Cisco VICs that are connected to a Fabric Interconnect cluster. 
* `iscsi_ip_v4_address_allocation_type`:(string) Static/Pool/DHCP Type of IP address allocated to the vNIC. It is derived from iSCSI boot policy IP Address type.* `None` - Type indicates that there is no IP associated to an vnic.* `DHCP` - The IP address is assigned using DHCP, if available.* `Static` - Static IPv4 address is assigned to the iSCSI boot interface based on the information entered in this area.* `Pool` - An IPv4 address is assigned to the iSCSI boot interface from the management IP address pool. 
* `iscsi_ipv4_address`:(string) IP address associated to the vNIC. 
* `mac_address`:(string) The MAC address that is assigned to the vNIC based on the MAC pool that has been assigned to the LAN Connectivity Policy. 
* `mac_address_type`:(string) Type of allocation selected to assign a MAC address for the vnic.* `POOL` - The user selects a pool from which the mac/wwn address will be leased for the Virtual Interface.* `STATIC` - The user assigns a static mac/wwn address for the Virtual Interface. 
* `mod_time`:(string) The time when this managed object was last modified. 
* `moid`:(string) The unique identifier of this Managed Object instance. 
* `name`:(string) Name of the virtual ethernet interface. 
* `order`:(int) The order in which the virtual interface is brought up. The order assigned to an interface should be unique for all the Ethernet and Fibre-Channel interfaces on each PCI link on a VIC adapter. The order should start from zero with no overlaps. The maximum value of PCI order is limited by the number of virtual interfaces (Ethernet and Fibre-Channel) on each PCI link on a VIC adapter. All VIC adapters have a single PCI link except VIC 1340, VIC 1380 and VIC 1385 which have two. 
* `pin_group_name`:(string) Pingroup name associated to vNIC for static pinning. LCP deploy will resolve pingroup name and fetches the correspoding uplink port/port channel to pin the vNIC traffic. 
* `shared_scope`:(string) Intersight provides pre-built workflows, tasks and policies to end users through global catalogs.Objects that are made available through global catalogs are said to have a 'shared' ownership. Shared objects are either made globally available to all end users or restricted to end users based on their license entitlement. Users can use this property to differentiate the scope (global or a specific license tier) to which a shared MO belongs. 
* `standby_vif_id`:(int) The Standby VIF Id is applicable for failover enabled vNICS. It should be the same as the channel number of the standby vethernet created on switch in order to set up the standby data path. 
* `static_mac_address`:(string) The MAC address must be in hexadecimal format xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx.To ensure uniqueness of MACs in the LAN fabric, you are strongly encouraged to use thefollowing MAC prefix 00:25:B5:xx:xx:xx. 
* `template_sync_status`:(string) The sync status of the current MO wrt the attached Template MO.* `None` - The Enum value represents that the object is not attached to any template.* `OK` - The Enum value represents that the object values are in sync with attached template.* `Scheduled` - The Enum value represents that the object sync from attached template is scheduled from template.* `InProgress` - The Enum value represents that the object sync with the attached template is in progress.* `OutOfSync` - The Enum value represents that the object values are not in sync with attached template. 
* `vif_id`:(int) The Vif Id should be same as the channel number of the vethernet created on switch in order to set up the data path. The property is applicable only for FI attached servers where a vethernet is created on the switch for every vNIC.
