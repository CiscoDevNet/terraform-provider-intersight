# Data Source: intersight_appliance_node_info
NodeInfo managed object stores the Intersight Appliance's cluster node information.
NodeInfo managed objects are created during the Intersight Appliance setup. The
Intersight Appliance updates the NodeInfo managed objects with status information
periodically.
## Argument Reference
The results of this data source are stored in `results` property.
All objects matching the filter criteria are fetched through pagination.
To access the ith object of the results obtained, use `data.intersight_appliance_node_info.<custom_name>.results[i].<propertyname>`.
The following arguments can be used to get data of already created objects in Intersight appliance:
* `account_moid`:(string) The Account ID for this managed object. 
* `create_time`:(string) The time when this managed object was created. 
* `domain_group_moid`:(string) The DomainGroup ID for this managed object. 
* `hostname`:(string) Cluster node's FQDN or IP address. 
* `mod_time`:(string) The time when this managed object was last modified. 
* `moid`:(string) The unique identifier of this Managed Object instance. 
* `node_id`:(int) System assigned unique ID of the Intersight Appliance node. The system incrementally assigns identifiers to each node in the Intersight Appliance cluster starting with a value of 1. 
* `operational_status`:(string) Operational status of the Intersight Appliance node.* `Unknown` - The status of the appliance node is unknown.* `Operational` - The appliance node is operational.* `Impaired` - The appliance node is impaired.* `AttentionNeeded` - The appliance node needs attention.* `ReadyToJoin` - The node is ready to be added to a standalone Intersight Appliance to form a cluster.* `OutOfService` - The user has taken this node (part of a cluster) to out of service.* `ReadyForReplacement` - The cluster node is ready to be replaced.* `ReplacementInProgress` - The cluster node replacement is in progress.* `ReplacementFailed` - There was a failure during the cluster node replacement. 
* `shared_scope`:(string) Intersight provides pre-built workflows, tasks and policies to end users through global catalogs.Objects that are made available through global catalogs are said to have a 'shared' ownership. Shared objects are either made globally available to all end users or restricted to end users based on their license entitlement. Users can use this property to differentiate the scope (global or a specific license tier) to which a shared MO belongs.
