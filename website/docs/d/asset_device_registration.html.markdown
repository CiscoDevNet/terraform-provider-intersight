# Data Source: intersight_asset_device_registration
DeviceRegistration represents a device connector enabled endpoint which has registered with Intersight.
## Argument Reference
The results of this data source are stored in `results` property.
All objects matching the filter criteria are fetched through pagination.
To access the ith object of the results obtained, use `data.intersight_asset_device_registration.<custom_name>.results[i].<propertyname>`.
The following arguments can be used to get data of already created objects in Intersight appliance:
* `access_key_id`:(string) An identifier for the credential used by the device connector to authenticate with the Intersight web socket gateway. 
* `account_moid`:(string) The Account ID for this managed object. 
* `api_version`:(int) The version of the connector API, describes the capability of the connector's framework.If the version is lower than the current minimum supported version defined in the service managing the connection, the device connector will be connected with limited capabilities until the device connector is upgraded to a fully supported version. For example if a device connector that was released without delta inventory capabilities registers and connects to Intersight, inventory collection may be disabled until it has been upgraded. 
* `app_partition_number`:(int) The partition number corresponding to the instance of the Proxy App which is managing the web-socket to the device connector. 
* `claimed_by_user_name`:(string) The name of the user who claimed the device for the account. 
* `claimed_time`:(string) The date and time at which the device was claimed to this account. 
* `connection_id`:(string) The unique identifier for the current connection. The identifier persists across network connectivity loss and is reset on device connector process restart or platform administrator toggle of the Intersight connectivity. The connectionId can be used by services that need to interact with stateful plugins running in the device connector process. For example if a service schedules an inventory in a devices job scheduler plugin at registration it is not necessary to reschedule the job if the device loses network connectivity due to an Intersight service upgrade or intermittent network issues in the devices datacenter. 
* `connection_reason`:(string) If 'connectionStatus' is not equal to Connected, connectionReason provides further details about why the device is not connected with Intersight. 
* `connection_status`:(string) The status of the persistent connection between the device connector and Intersight.* `` - The target details have been persisted but Intersight has not yet attempted to connect to the target.* `Connected` - Intersight is able to establish a connection to the target and initiate management activities.* `NotConnected` - Intersight is unable to establish a connection to the target.* `ClaimInProgress` - Claim of the target is in progress. A connection to the target has not been fully established.* `UnclaimInProgress` - Unclaim of the target is in progress. Intersight is able to connect to the target and all management operations are supported.* `Unclaimed` - The device was un-claimed from the users account by an Administrator of the device. Also indicates the failure to claim Targets of type HTTP Endpoint in Intersight.* `Claimed` - Target of type HTTP Endpoint is successfully claimed in Intersight. Currently no validation is performed to verify the Target connectivity from Intersight at the time of creation. However invoking API from Intersight Orchestrator fails if this Target is not reachable from Intersight or if Target API credentials are incorrect. 
* `connection_status_last_change_time`:(string) The last time at which the 'connectionStatus' property value changed. If connectionStatus is Connected, this time can be interpreted as the starting time since which a persistent connection has been maintained between Intersight and Device Connector. If connectionStatus is NotConnected, this time can be interpreted as the last time the device connector was connected with Intersight. 
* `connector_version`:(string) The version of the device connector running on the managed device. 
* `create_time`:(string) The time when this managed object was created. 
* `device_external_ip_address`:(string) The IP Address of the managed device as seen from Intersight at the time of registration.This could be the IP address of the managed device's interface which has a route to the internet or a NAT IP address when the managed device is deployed in a private network. 
* `domain_group_moid`:(string) The DomainGroup ID for this managed object. 
* `execution_mode`:(string) Indicates if the platform is an actual device or an emulated device for testing, demos, etc. Permitted values are [Normal, Emulator, ContainerEmulator].* `` - The device reported an empty or unrecognized executionMode.* `Normal` - The device connector is running in normal mode, i.e. it is not a simulation.* `Emulator` - The device connector is running in simulation mode inside an emulated device.* `ContainerEmulator` - The device connector is running in simulation mode inside a containerized emulated device.
