# Data Source: intersight_fc_physical_port
The physical interface on the Fabric Interconnect to which a Fibre Channel (FC) target can be connected to within a data center.
## Argument Reference
The results of this data source are stored in `results` property.
All objects matching the filter criteria are fetched through pagination.
To access the ith object of the results obtained, use `data.intersight_fc_physical_port.<custom_name>.results[i].<propertyname>`.
The following arguments can be used to get data of already created objects in Intersight appliance:
* `account_moid`:(string) The Account ID for this managed object. 
* `admin_speed`:(string) Administrator configured Speed applied on the port. 
* `admin_state`:(string) Administratively configured state (enabled/disabled) for this port. 
* `aggregate_port_id`:(int) Breakout port member in the Fabric Interconnect. 
* `b2b_credit`:(int) Buffer to Buffer credits of FC port. 
* `create_time`:(string) The time when this managed object was created. 
* `device_mo_id`:(string) The database identifier of the registered device of an object. 
* `dn`:(string) The Distinguished Name unambiguously identifies an object in the system. 
* `domain_group_moid`:(string) The DomainGroup ID for this managed object. 
* `max_speed`:(string) Maximum Speed with which the port operates. 
* `mod_time`:(string) The time when this managed object was last modified. 
* `mode`:(string) Mode information N_proxy, F or E associated to the Fibre Channel port. 
* `moid`:(string) The unique identifier of this Managed Object instance. 
* `name`:(string) Name of the physical port of FC. 
* `oper_speed`:(string) Operational Speed with which the port operates. 
* `oper_state`:(string) Operational state of this port (enabled/disabled). 
* `oper_state_qual`:(string) Reason for this port's Operational state. 
* `peer_dn`:(string) PeerDn for fibre channel physical port. 
* `port_channel_id`:(int) Port channel id of FC port channel created on FI switch. 
* `port_id`:(int) Switch physical port identifier. 
* `rn`:(string) The Relative Name uniquely identifies an object within a given context. 
* `role`:(string) The role assigned to this port. 
* `shared_scope`:(string) Intersight provides pre-built workflows, tasks and policies to end users through global catalogs.Objects that are made available through global catalogs are said to have a 'shared' ownership. Shared objects are either made globally available to all end users or restricted to end users based on their license entitlement. Users can use this property to differentiate the scope (global or a specific license tier) to which a shared MO belongs. 
* `slot_id`:(int) Switch expansion slot module identifier. 
* `switch_id`:(string) Switch Identifier that is local to a cluster. 
* `transceiver_type`:(string) Transceiver type of a Fibre Channel port. 
* `vsan`:(int) Virtual San that is associated to the port. 
* `wwn`:(string) World Wide Name of a Fibre Channel port.
