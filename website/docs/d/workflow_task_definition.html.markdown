description: |-
        Used to define a task which can be included within a workflow. Task definition conveys the intent that we want to achieve with the task. We can have a standalone task definition that is bound to a single implementation for that task, or we can define an TaskDefinition that will serve as the interface task definition which is linked to multiple implementation tasks. Each implemented TaskDefinition will be bound to its own implementation so we can achieve a case where single TaskDefinition has multiple implementations.

# Data Source: intersight_workflow_task_definition
Used to define a task which can be included within a workflow. Task definition conveys the intent that we want to achieve with the task. We can have a standalone task definition that is bound to a single implementation for that task, or we can define an TaskDefinition that will serve as the interface task definition which is linked to multiple implementation tasks. Each implemented TaskDefinition will be bound to its own implementation so we can achieve a case where single TaskDefinition has multiple implementations.
## Argument Reference
The results of this data source are stored in `results` property.
All objects matching the filter criteria are fetched through pagination.
To access the ith object of the results obtained, use `data.intersight_workflow_task_definition.<custom_name>.results[i].<propertyname>`.
The following arguments can be used to get data of already created objects in Intersight appliance:
* `account_moid`:(string) The Account ID for this managed object. 
* `create_time`:(string) The time when this managed object was created. 
* `default_version`:(bool) When true this will be the task version that is used when a specific task definition version is not specified. The very first task definition created with a name will be set as the default version, after that user can explicitly set any version of the task definition as the default version. 
* `description`:(string) A user friendly description about task on what operations are done as part of the task execution and any other specific information about task input and output. 
* `domain_group_moid`:(string) The DomainGroup ID for this managed object. 
* `label`:(string) A user friendly short name to identify the task definition. Label can only contain letters (a-z, A-Z), numbers (0-9), hyphen (-), period (.), colon (:), space ( ), single quote ('), forward slash (/), or an underscore (_) and must be at least 2 characters. 
* `license_entitlement`:(string) License entitlement required to run this task. It is determined by license requirement of features.* `Base` - Base as a License type. It is default license type.* `Essential` - Essential as a License type.* `Standard` - Standard as a License type.* `Advantage` - Advantage as a License type.* `Premier` - Premier as a License type.* `IWO-Essential` - IWO-Essential as a License type.* `IWO-Advantage` - IWO-Advantage as a License type.* `IWO-Premier` - IWO-Premier as a License type.* `IKS-Advantage` - IKS-Advantage as a License type.* `INC-Premier-1GFixed` - Premier 1G Fixed license tier for Intersight Nexus Cloud.* `INC-Premier-10GFixed` - Premier 10G Fixed license tier for Intersight Nexus Cloud.* `INC-Premier-100GFixed` - Premier 100G Fixed license tier for Intersight Nexus Cloud.* `INC-Premier-Mod4Slot` - Premier Modular 4 slot license tier for Intersight Nexus Cloud.* `INC-Premier-Mod8Slot` - Premier Modular 8 slot license tier for Intersight Nexus Cloud.* `INC-Premier-D2OpsFixed` - Premier D2Ops fixed license tier for Intersight Nexus Cloud.* `INC-Premier-D2OpsMod` - Premier D2Ops modular license tier for Intersight Nexus Cloud.* `INC-Premier-CentralizedMod8Slot` - Premier modular license tier of switch type CentralizedMod8Slot for Intersight Nexus Cloud.* `INC-Premier-DistributedMod8Slot` - Premier modular license tier of switch type DistributedMod8Slot for Intersight Nexus Cloud.* `ERP-Advantage` - Advantage license tier for ERP workflows.* `IntersightTrial` - Virtual dummy license type to indicate trial. Used for UI display of trial mode Intersight tiers.* `IWOTrial` - Virtual dummy license type to indicate trial. Used for UI display of trial mode IKS tiers.* `IKSTrial` - Virtual dummy license type to indicate trial. Used for UI display of trial mode IWO tiers.* `INCTrial` - Virtual dummy license type to indicate trial. Used for UI display of trial mode Nexus tiers. 
* `mod_time`:(string) The time when this managed object was last modified. 
* `moid`:(string) The unique identifier of this Managed Object instance. 
* `name`:(string) The name of the task definition. The name should follow this convention <Verb or Action><Category><Vendor><Product><Noun or object> Verb or Action is a required portion of the name and this must be part of the pre-approved verb list. Category is an optional field and this will refer to the broad category of the task referring to the type of resource or endpoint. If there is no specific category then use \ Generic\  if required. Vendor is an optional field and this will refer to the specific vendor this task applies to. If the task is generic and not tied to a vendor, then do not specify anything. Product is an optional field, this will contain the vendor product and model when desired. Noun or object is a required field and  this will contain the noun or object on which the action is being performed. Name can only contain letters (a-z, A-Z), numbers (0-9), hyphen (-), period (.), colon (:), or an underscore (_). Examples SendEmail  - This is a task in Generic category for sending email. NewStorageVolume - This is a vendor agnostic task under Storage device category for creating a new volume. 
* `secure_prop_access`:(bool) If set to true, the task requires access to secure properties and uses an encryption token associated with a workflow moid to encrypt or decrypt the secure properties. 
* `shared_scope`:(string) Intersight provides pre-built workflows, tasks and policies to end users through global catalogs.Objects that are made available through global catalogs are said to have a 'shared' ownership. Shared objects are either made globally available to all end users or restricted to end users based on their license entitlement. Users can use this property to differentiate the scope (global or a specific license tier) to which a shared MO belongs. 
* `nr_version`:(int) The version of the task definition so we can support multiple versions of a task definition.
