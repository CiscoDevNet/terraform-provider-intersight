# Data Source: intersight_virtualization_vmware_datacenter
Datacenter object in VMware inventory. It is the logical container for all other objects like Datastore, Host, VirtualMachine, etc.
## Argument Reference
The results of this data source are stored in `results` property.
All objects matching the filter criteria are fetched through pagination.
To access the ith object of the results obtained, use `data.intersight_virtualization_vmware_datacenter.<custom_name>.results[i].<propertyname>`.
