# Data Source: intersight_connectorpack_upgrade_impact
Used to determine the list of connector packs to be installed on a target UCS Director in its next upgrade cycle. Accepts the moid of the target UcsdInfo as part of the filter query. Given below is a sample url :- https://{{target}}/api/v1/connectorpack/UpgradeImpacts? $filter= ( UcsdInfo.Moid eq <<MoId>> ).
## Argument Reference
The results of this data source are stored in `results` property.
All objects matching the filter criteria are fetched through pagination.
To access the ith object of the results obtained, use `data.intersight_connectorpack_upgrade_impact.<custom_name>.results[i].<propertyname>`.
The following arguments can be used to get data of already created objects in Intersight appliance:
* `account_moid`:(string) The Account ID for this managed object. 
* `create_time`:(string) The time when this managed object was created. 
* `domain_group_moid`:(string) The DomainGroup ID for this managed object. 
* `is_eligible_for_upgrade`:(bool) States whether the UCS Director is eligible for an upgrade. Set to true if connector packs are available for upgrade, else set to false. 
* `is_update_downloaded`:(bool) States whether all the requisite updates have been downloaded to the target UCS Director. Set to true if all connector packs required to upgrade UCS Director to the next iteration have been downloaded, else set to false. 
* `mod_time`:(string) The time when this managed object was last modified. 
* `moid`:(string) The unique identifier of this Managed Object instance. 
* `shared_scope`:(string) Intersight provides pre-built workflows, tasks and policies to end users through global catalogs.Objects that are made available through global catalogs are said to have a 'shared' ownership. Shared objects are either made globally available to all end users or restricted to end users based on their license entitlement. Users can use this property to differentiate the scope (global or a specific license tier) to which a shared MO belongs.
