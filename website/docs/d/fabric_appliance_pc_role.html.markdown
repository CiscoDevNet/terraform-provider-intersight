# Data Source: intersight_fabric_appliance_pc_role
Configuration object sent by user to create an appliance port channel.
## Argument Reference
The results of this data source are stored in `results` property.
All objects matching the filter criteria are fetched through pagination.
To access the ith object of the results obtained, use `data.intersight_fabric_appliance_pc_role.<custom_name>.results[i].<propertyname>`.
The following arguments can be used to get data of already created objects in Intersight appliance:
* `account_moid`:(string) The Account ID for this managed object. 
* `admin_speed`:(string) Admin configured speed for the port channel.* `Auto` - Admin configurable speed AUTO ( default ).* `1Gbps` - Admin configurable speed 1Gbps.* `10Gbps` - Admin configurable speed 10Gbps.* `25Gbps` - Admin configurable speed 25Gbps.* `40Gbps` - Admin configurable speed 40Gbps.* `100Gbps` - Admin configurable speed 100Gbps.* `NegAuto25Gbps` - Admin configurable 25Gbps auto negotiation for ports and port-channels.Speed is applicable on Ethernet Uplink, Ethernet Appliance and FCoE Uplink port and port-channel roles.This speed config is only applicable to non-breakout ports on UCS-FI-6454 and UCS-FI-64108. 
* `create_time`:(string) The time when this managed object was created. 
* `domain_group_moid`:(string) The DomainGroup ID for this managed object. 
* `fec`:(string) Forward error correction configuration for Appliance Port Channel member ports.* `Auto` - Forward error correction option 'Auto'.* `Cl91` - Forward error correction option 'cl91'.* `Cl74` - Forward error correction option 'cl74'. 
* `mod_time`:(string) The time when this managed object was last modified. 
* `mode`:(string) Port mode to be set on the appliance port-channel.* `trunk` - Trunk Mode Switch Port Type.* `access` - Access Mode Switch Port Type. 
* `moid`:(string) The unique identifier of this Managed Object instance. 
* `pc_id`:(int) Unique Identifier of the port-channel, local to this switch. 
* `priority`:(string) The 'name' of the System QoS Class.* `Best Effort` - QoS Priority for Best-effort traffic.* `FC` - QoS Priority for FC traffic.* `Platinum` - QoS Priority for Platinum traffic.* `Gold` - QoS Priority for Gold traffic.* `Silver` - QoS Priority for Silver traffic.* `Bronze` - QoS Priority for Bronze traffic. 
* `shared_scope`:(string) Intersight provides pre-built workflows, tasks and policies to end users through global catalogs.Objects that are made available through global catalogs are said to have a 'shared' ownership. Shared objects are either made globally available to all end users or restricted to end users based on their license entitlement. Users can use this property to differentiate the scope (global or a specific license tier) to which a shared MO belongs.
