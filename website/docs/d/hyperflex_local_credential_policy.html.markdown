# Data Source: intersight_hyperflex_local_credential_policy
A policy specifying credentials for HyperFlex cluster such as controller VM password, hypervisor username, and password.
## Argument Reference
The results of this data source are stored in `results` property.
All objects matching the filter criteria are fetched through pagination.
To access the ith object of the results obtained, use `data.intersight_hyperflex_local_credential_policy.<custom_name>.results[i].<propertyname>`.
The following arguments can be used to get data of already created objects in Intersight appliance:
* `account_moid`:(string) The Account ID for this managed object. 
* `create_time`:(string) The time when this managed object was created. 
* `description`:(string) Description of the policy. 
* `domain_group_moid`:(string) The DomainGroup ID for this managed object. 
* `factory_hypervisor_password`:(bool) Indicates if Hypervisor password is the factory set default password. For HyperFlex Data Platform versions 3.0 or higher, enable this if the default password was not changed on the Hypervisor. It is required to supply a new custom Hypervisor password that will be applied to the Hypervisor during deployment. For HyperFlex Data Platform versions prior to 3.0 release, this setting has no effect and the default password will be used for initial install. The Hypervisor password should be changed after deployment. 
* `hxdp_root_pwd`:(string) HyperFlex storage controller VM password must contain a minimum of 10 characters, with at least 1 lowercase, 1 uppercase, 1 numeric, and 1 of these -._@#$%^&*! special characters. 
* `hypervisor_admin`:(string) Hypervisor administrator username must contain only alphanumeric characters. 
* `hypervisor_admin_pwd`:(string) The Hypervisor root password. For HyperFlex Data Platform 3.0 or later, if the factory default password was not manually changed, you must set a new custom password. If the password was manually changed, you must not enable the factory default password property and provide the current hypervisor password. Note - All HyperFlex nodes require the same hypervisor password for installation. For HyperFlex Data Platform prior to 3.0, use the default password \ Cisco123\  for newly manufactured HyperFlex servers. A custom password should only be entered if hypervisor credentials were manually changed prior to deployment. 
* `is_deployment_private_key_set`:(bool) Indicates whether the value of the 'deploymentPrivateKey' property has been set. 
* `is_hxdp_root_pwd_set`:(bool) Indicates whether the value of the 'hxdpRootPwd' property has been set. 
* `is_hypervisor_admin_pwd_set`:(bool) Indicates whether the value of the 'hypervisorAdminPwd' property has been set. 
* `mod_time`:(string) The time when this managed object was last modified. 
* `moid`:(string) The unique identifier of this Managed Object instance. 
* `name`:(string) Name of the concrete policy. 
* `shared_scope`:(string) Intersight provides pre-built workflows, tasks and policies to end users through global catalogs.Objects that are made available through global catalogs are said to have a 'shared' ownership. Shared objects are either made globally available to all end users or restricted to end users based on their license entitlement. Users can use this property to differentiate the scope (global or a specific license tier) to which a shared MO belongs.
