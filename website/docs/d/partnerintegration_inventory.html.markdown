* `action`:(string) Action to be performed on the inventory collection.* `None` - Default Value of the action, i.e. do nothing.* `Build` - Build the inventory service image.* `Deploy` - Deploy the inventory service on the appliance. 
* `build_flags`:(string) Addtional flags to control build action. 
* `build_start_time`:(string) Time when build was triggered. 
* `build_status`:(string) Status of build for inventory collection.* `None` - Default value of the status. i.e. done nothing.* `BackendInProgress` - The backend build is in progress.* `BackendFailed` - The backend build has failed.* `MetricsCollectorBackendInProgress` - The Metrics Collector backend build is in progress.* `MetricsCollectorBackendFailed` - The Metrics Collector backend build has failed.* `DockerInProgress` - The docker build is in progress.* `DockerFailed` - The docker build has failed.* `UiInProgress` - The UI build is in progress.* `UiFailed` - The inventory UI build has failed.* `MetricsCollectorUiInProgress` - The Metrics Collector UI build is in progress.* `MetricsCollectorUiFailed` - The Metrics Collector UI build has failed.* `MetricsCollectorDependentBackendInProgress` - The Metrics Collector dependent backend build is in progress.* `MetricsCollectorDependentBackendFailed` - The Metrics Collector dependent backend build has failed.* `MetricsCollectorDependentDockerInProgress` - The Metrics Collector dependent docker build is in progress.* `MetricsCollectorDependentDockerFailed` - The Metrics Collector dependent docker build has failed.* `ApidocsInProgress` - The apidocs build is in progress.* `ApidocsFailed` - The apidocs build has failed.* `Completed` - The operation completed successfully. 
* `create_time`:(string) The time when this managed object was created. 
* `deploy_start_time`:(string) Time when deploy was triggered.
