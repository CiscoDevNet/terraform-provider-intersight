# Data Source: intersight_server_profile
A profile specifying configuration settings for a physical server.
## Argument Reference
The results of this data source are stored in `results` property.
All objects matching the filter criteria are fetched through pagination.
To access the ith object of the results obtained, use `data.intersight_server_profile.<custom_name>.results[i].<propertyname>`.
The following arguments can be used to get data of already created objects in Intersight appliance:
* `account_moid`:(string) The Account ID for this managed object. 
* `action`:(string) User initiated action. Each profile type has its own supported actions. For HyperFlex cluster profile, the supported actions are -- Validate, Deploy, Continue, Retry, Abort, Unassign For server profile, the support actions are -- Deploy, Unassign. 
* `create_time`:(string) The time when this managed object was created. 
* `deploy_status`:(string) The status of the server profile indicating if deployment has been initiated on both fabric interconnects or not.* `None` - Switch profiles not deployed on either of the switches.* `Complete` - Both switch profiles of the cluster profile are deployed.* `Partial` - Only one of the switch profiles of the cluster profile is deployed. 
* `deployed_switches`:(string) The property which determines if the deployment should be skipped on any of the Fabric Interconnects. It is set based on the state of a fabric interconnect to Intersight before the deployment of the server proile begins.* `None` - Server profile configuration not deployed on either of the fabric interconnects.* `AB` - Server profile configuration deployed on both fabric interconnects.* `A` - Server profile configuration deployed on fabric interconnect A only.* `B` - Server profile configuration deployed on fabric interconnect B only. 
* `description`:(string) Description of the profile. 
* `domain_group_moid`:(string) The DomainGroup ID for this managed object. 
* `is_pmc_deployed_secure_passphrase_set`:(bool) Indicates whether the value of the 'pmcDeployedSecurePassphrase' property has been set. 
* `management_mode`:(string) The management mode of the server.* `IntersightStandalone` - Intersight Standalone mode of operation.* `Intersight` - Intersight managed mode of operation. 
* `mod_time`:(string) The time when this managed object was last modified. 
* `moid`:(string) The unique identifier of this Managed Object instance. 
* `name`:(string) Name of the profile instance or profile template. 
* `pmc_deployed_secure_passphrase`:(string) Secure passphrase that is already deployed on all the Persistent Memory Modules on the server. This deployed passphrase is required during deploy of server profile if secure passphrase is changed or security is disabled in the attached persistent memory policy. 
* `server_assignment_mode`:(string) Source of the server assigned to the Server Profile. Values can be Static, Pool or None. Static is used if a server is attached directly to a Server Profile. Pool is used if a resource pool is attached to a Server Profile. None is used if no server or resource pool is attached to a Server Profile. Slot or Serial pre-assignment is also considered to be None as it is different form of Assign Later.* `None` - No server is assigned to the server profile.* `Static` - Server is directly assigned to server profile using assign server.* `Pool` - Server is assigned from a resource pool. 
* `server_pre_assign_by_serial`:(string) Serial number of the server that would be assigned to this pre-assigned Server Profile. It can be any string that adheres to the following constraints:It should start and end with an alphanumeric character.It cannot be more than 20 characters. 
* `shared_scope`:(string) Intersight provides pre-built workflows, tasks and policies to end users through global catalogs.Objects that are made available through global catalogs are said to have a 'shared' ownership. Shared objects are either made globally available to all end users or restricted to end users based on their license entitlement. Users can use this property to differentiate the scope (global or a specific license tier) to which a shared MO belongs. 
* `static_uuid_address`:(string) The UUID address for the server must include UUID prefix xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx along with the UUID suffix of format xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx. 
* `target_platform`:(string) The platform for which the server profile is applicable. It can either be a server that is operating in standalone mode or which is attached to a Fabric Interconnect managed by Intersight.* `Standalone` - Servers which are operating in standalone mode i.e. not connected to a Fabric Interconnected.* `FIAttached` - Servers which are connected to a Fabric Interconnect that is managed by Intersight. 
* `type`:(string) Defines the type of the profile. Accepted values are instance or template.* `instance` - The profile defines the configuration for a specific instance of a target. 
* `user_label`:(string) User label assigned to the server profile. 
* `uuid`:(string) The UUID address that is assigned to the server based on the UUID pool. 
* `uuid_address_type`:(string) UUID address allocation type selected to assign an UUID address for the server.* `NONE` - The user did not assign any UUID address.* `STATIC` - The user assigns a static UUID address.* `POOL` - The user selects a pool from which the address will be leased.
