        # Overview
        The RetentionConfig object provides default configurations for audit log retention,
        offering a standardized approach to managing retention periods in the absence of specific policies.
        ## Purpose
        RetentionConfig serves as a baseline configuration for audit log retention,
        ensuring logs are preserved for a defined period by default when no explicit retention policy exists.
        This helps maintain consistent log management practices across the system.
        ## Key Concepts
        - **Default Settings** – Establishes default retention periods, ensuring systematic log retention even without custom policies.
        - **System Ownership** – Managed by the system to guarantee reliable and consistent application of retention settings across all accounts.
        - **Read-Only Access** – Designed for safe consumption, ensuring default configurations are applied without unauthorized modifications.
        - **Policy Integration** – Complements account-specific RetentionPolicies, harmonizing log retention across the system.
