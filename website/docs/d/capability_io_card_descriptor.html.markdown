# Data Source: intersight_capability_io_card_descriptor
Descriptor that uniquely identifies an IO card module.
## Argument Reference
The results of this data source are stored in `results` property.
All objects matching the filter criteria are fetched through pagination.
To access the ith object of the results obtained, use `data.intersight_capability_io_card_descriptor.<custom_name>.results[i].<propertyname>`.
The following arguments can be used to get data of already created objects in Intersight appliance:
* `account_moid`:(string) The Account ID for this managed object. 
* `bif_port_num`:(int) Identifies the bif port number for the iocard module.
