# Data Source: intersight_fabric_port_operation
PortOperation objects allows the user to alter the state of the port.
## Argument Reference
The results of this data source are stored in `results` property.
All objects matching the filter criteria are fetched through pagination.
To access the ith object of the results obtained, use `data.intersight_fabric_port_operation.results[i].<propertyname>`.
The following arguments can be used to get data of already created objects in Intersight appliance:
* `account_moid`:(string) The Account ID for this managed object. 
* `admin_state`:(string) Admin configured state to disable the port.* `Enabled` - Admin configured Enabled State.* `Disabled` - Admin configured Disabled State. 
* `aggregate_port_id`:(int) Breakout port Identifier of the Switch Interface.When a port is not configured as a breakout port, the aggregatePortId is set to 0, and unused.When a port is configured as a breakout port, the 'aggregatePortId' port number as labeled on the equipment,e.g. the id of the port on the switch. 
* `config_state`:(string) The configured state of these settings in the target chassis. The value is any one of Applied, Applying, Failed. Applied - This state denotes that the admin state changes are applied successfully in the target FI domain. Applying - This state denotes that the admin state changes are being applied in the target FI domain. Failed - This state denotes that the admin state changes could not be applied in the target FI domain.* `None` - Nil value when no action has been triggered by the user.* `Applied` - User configured settings are in applied state.* `Applying` - User settings are being applied on the target server.* `Failed` - User configured settings could not be applied. 
* `create_time`:(string) The time when this managed object was created. 
* `domain_group_moid`:(string) The DomainGroup ID for this managed object. 
* `mod_time`:(string) The time when this managed object was last modified. 
* `moid`:(string) The unique identifier of this Managed Object instance. 
* `port_id`:(int) Port Identifier of the Switch/FEX/Chassis Interface.When a port is not configured as a breakout port, the portId is the port number as labeled on the equipment,e.g. the id of the port on the switch, FEX or chassis.When a port is configured as a breakout port, the 'portId' represents the port id on the fanout side of the breakout cable. 
* `shared_scope`:(string) Intersight provides pre-built workflows, tasks and policies to end users through global catalogs.Objects that are made available through global catalogs are said to have a 'shared' ownership.
