# Data Source: intersight_fabric_port_operation
PortOperation objects allows the user to alter the state of the port.
## Argument Reference
The results of this data source are stored in `results` property.
All objects matching the filter criteria are fetched through pagination.
To access the ith object of the results obtained, use `data.intersight_fabric_port_operation.<custom_name>.results[i].<propertyname>`.
The following arguments can be used to get data of already created objects in Intersight appliance:
* `account_moid`:(string) The Account ID for this managed object. 
* `admin_action`:(string) An operation that has to be perfomed on the switch or IOM port. Default value is None which means there will be no implicit port operation triggered.* `None` - No admin triggered action.* `ResetServerPortConfiguration` - Admin triggered operation to reset the server port to its original configuration. 
* `admin_state`:(string) Admin configured state to disable the port.* `Enabled` - Admin configured Enabled State.* `Disabled` - Admin configured Disabled State. 
* `aggregate_port_id`:(int) Breakout port Identifier of the Switch Interface.When a port is not configured as a breakout port, the aggregatePortId is set to 0, and unused.When a port is configured as a breakout port, the 'aggregatePortId' port number as labeled on the equipment,e.g. the id of the port on the switch. 
* `config_state`:(string) The configured state of these settings in the target chassis. The value is any one of Applied, Applying, Failed. Applied - This state denotes that the admin state changes are applied successfully in the target FI domain. Applying - This state denotes that the admin state changes are being applied in the target FI domain. Failed - This state denotes that the admin state changes could not be applied in the target FI domain.* `None` - Nil value when no action has been triggered by the user.* `Applied` - User configured settings are in applied state.* `Applying` - User settings are being applied on the target server.* `Failed` - User configured settings could not be applied. 
* `create_time`:(string) The time when this managed object was created. 
* `domain_group_moid`:(string) The DomainGroup ID for this managed object. 
* `fex_id`:(int) FEX/IOM identifier to denote its Host ports in the format - FexId/SlotId/PortId. 
* `mod_time`:(string) The time when this managed object was last modified. 
* `moid`:(string) The unique identifier of this Managed Object instance. 
* `port_id`:(int) Port Identifier of the Switch/FEX/Chassis Interface.When a port is not configured as a breakout port, the portId is the port number as labeled on the equipment,e.g. the id of the port on the switch, FEX or chassis.When a port is configured as a breakout port, the 'portId' represents the port id on the fanout side of the breakout cable. 
* `shared_scope`:(string) Intersight provides pre-built workflows, tasks and policies to end users through global catalogs.Objects that are made available through global catalogs are said to have a 'shared' ownership. Shared objects are either made globally available to all end users or restricted to end users based on their license entitlement. Users can use this property to differentiate the scope (global or a specific license tier) to which a shared MO belongs. 
* `slot_id`:(int) Slot Identifier of the Switch/FEX/Chassis Interface.
