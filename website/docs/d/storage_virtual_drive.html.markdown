# Data Source: intersight_storage_virtual_drive
A Virtual Disk Drive or Logical Unit Number.
## Argument Reference
The results of this data source are stored in `results` property.
All objects matching the filter criteria are fetched through pagination.
To access the ith object of the results obtained, use `data.intersight_storage_virtual_drive.<custom_name>.results[i].<propertyname>`.
The following arguments can be used to get data of already created objects in Intersight appliance:
* `access_policy`:(string) The access policy of the virtual drive.
