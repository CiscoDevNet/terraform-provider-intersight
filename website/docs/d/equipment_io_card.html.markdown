# Data Source: intersight_equipment_io_card
I/O module on a chassis which multiplexes traffic from blade servers.
## Argument Reference
The results of this data source are stored in `results` property.
All objects matching the filter criteria are fetched through pagination.
To access the ith object of the results obtained, use `data.intersight_equipment_io_card.<custom_name>.results[i].<propertyname>`.
The following arguments can be used to get data of already created objects in Intersight appliance:
* `account_moid`:(string) The Account ID for this managed object. 
* `connection_path`:(string) Switch Id to which the IOM is connected to. The value can be A or B. 
* `connection_status`:(string) Connectivity Status of FEX/IOM to Switch - A or B or AB. 
* `create_time`:(string) The time when this managed object was created. 
* `dc_supported`:(bool) IOM device connector support. 
* `description`:(string) This field is to provide description for the iocard module model. 
* `device_mo_id`:(string) The database identifier of the registered device of an object. 
* `dn`:(string) The Distinguished Name unambiguously identifies an object in the system. 
* `domain_group_moid`:(string) The DomainGroup ID for this managed object. 
* `is_upgraded`:(bool) This field indicates the compute status of the catalog values for the associated component or hardware. 
* `mod_time`:(string) The time when this managed object was last modified.
