# Data Source: intersight_storage_physical_disk
Physical Disk on a server.
## Argument Reference
The results of this data source are stored in `results` property.
All objects matching the filter criteria are fetched through pagination.
To access the ith object of the results obtained, use `data.intersight_storage_physical_disk.<custom_name>.results[i].<propertyname>`.
