# Data Source: intersight_vnic_eth_adapter_policy
An Ethernet adapter policy governs the host-side behavior of the adapter, including how the adapter handles traffic. For each VIC Virtual Ethernet Interface various features like VXLAN, NVGRE, ARFS, Interrupt settings, and TCP Offload settings can be configured.
## Argument Reference
The results of this data source are stored in `results` property.
All objects matching the filter criteria are fetched through pagination.
To access the ith object of the results obtained, use `data.intersight_vnic_eth_adapter_policy.results[i].<propertyname>`.
The following arguments can be used to get data of already created objects in Intersight appliance:
* `account_moid`:(string) The Account ID for this managed object. 
* `advanced_filter`:(bool) Enables advanced filtering on the interface. 
* `create_time`:(string) The time when this managed object was created. 
* `description`:(string) Description of the policy. 
* `domain_group_moid`:(string) The DomainGroup ID for this managed object. 
* `interrupt_scaling`:(bool) Enables Interrupt Scaling on the interface. 
* `mod_time`:(string) The time when this managed object was last modified. 
* `moid`:(string) The unique identifier of this Managed Object instance. 
* `name`:(string) Name of the concrete policy. 
* `rss_settings`:(bool) Receive Side Scaling allows the incoming traffic to be spread across multiple CPU cores. 
* `shared_scope`:(string) Intersight provides pre-built workflows, tasks and policies to end users through global catalogs.Objects that are made available through global catalogs are said to have a 'shared' ownership. Shared objects are either made globally available to all end users or restricted to end users based on their license entitlement. Users can use this property to differentiate the scope (global or a specific license tier) to which a shared MO belongs. 
* `uplink_failback_timeout`:(int) Uplink Failback Timeout in seconds when uplink failover is enabled for a vNIC. After a vNIC has started using its secondary interface, this setting controls how long the primary interface must be available before the system resumes using the primary interface for the vNIC.
