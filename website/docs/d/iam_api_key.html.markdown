        An API key is used to authenticate and authorize API requests sent by a client using the HTTP signature scheme. API keys can be used by unattended, daemon clients that need to send requests to Intersight programmatically. API keys are based on public key cryptography.
        To create an API key, the user must specify: 1. The purpose (description) of the API key, 2. The cryptographic hash algorithm, which is used to compute the digest of the body of HTTP requests, 3. The cryptographic parameters to generate a private/public key pair, e.g. RSA, ECDSA, EDDSA, key modulus, and 4. The signing algorithm, e.g. RSA PKCS v1.5, RSA PSS, ECDSA, EDDSA. The generated private key and public key are encoded in PEM format.
        The client owns the private key and is responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of the private key. The server holds the public key.
        The client must have a cryptographic provider compatible with the cryptographic parameters specified in the API key. For example, if you use the powershell SDK to write the client, make sure the appropriate cryptographic providers are installed on the local system. If you create an RSA key pair with modulus set to 2048, the client must support 2048-bit private keys. A maximum of 3 API keys per user is allowed.
        API keys are used to sign HTTP requests as follows: 1. A cryptographic digest of the body of the HTTP request is calculated using one of the supported cryptographic hash algorithms. 2. The value of the digest is base-64 encoded in the `Digest` HTTP header. 3. A signature is calculated as specified in the HTTP signature scheme, and the signature is added to the `Authorization` HTTP request header.

# Data Source: intersight_iam_api_key
An API key is used to authenticate and authorize API requests sent by a client using the HTTP signature scheme. API keys can be used by unattended, daemon clients that need to send requests to Intersight programmatically. API keys are based on public key cryptography.
To create an API key, the user must specify: 1. The purpose (description) of the API key, 2. The cryptographic hash algorithm, which is used to compute the digest of the body of HTTP requests, 3. The cryptographic parameters to generate a private/public key pair, e.g. RSA, ECDSA, EDDSA, key modulus, and 4. The signing algorithm, e.g. RSA PKCS v1.5, RSA PSS, ECDSA, EDDSA. The generated private key and public key are encoded in PEM format.
The client owns the private key and is responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of the private key. The server holds the public key.
The client must have a cryptographic provider compatible with the cryptographic parameters specified in the API key. For example, if you use the powershell SDK to write the client, make sure the appropriate cryptographic providers are installed on the local system. If you create an RSA key pair with modulus set to 2048, the client must support 2048-bit private keys. A maximum of 3 API keys per user is allowed.

## Argument Reference
The results of this data source are stored in `results` property.
All objects matching the filter criteria are fetched through pagination.
To access the ith object of the results obtained, use `data.intersight_iam_api_key.<custom_name>.results[i].<propertyname>`.
The following arguments can be used to get data of already created objects in Intersight appliance:
* `account_moid`:(string) The Account ID for this managed object. 
* `admin_status`:(string) Used to trigger the enable or disable action on the API key. These actions change the status of an API key.* `enable` - Used to enable a disabled API key/App Registration. If the API key/App Registration is already expired, this action has no effect.* `disable` - Used to disable an active API key/App Registration. If the API key/App Registration is already expired, this action has no effect. 
* `create_time`:(string) The time when this managed object was created. 
* `domain_group_moid`:(string) The DomainGroup ID for this managed object. 
* `expiry_date_time`:(string) The expiration date of the API key which is set at the time of creation of the key. Its value can only be assigned a date that falls within the range determined by the maximum expiration time configured at the account level. The expiry date can be edited to be earlier or later, provided it stays within the designated expiry period. This period is determined by adding the 'startTime' property of the API key to the maximum expiry time configured at the account level. 
* `hash_algorithm`:(string) The cryptographic hash algorithm to calculate the message digest.* `SHA256` - The SHA-256 cryptographic hash, as defined by NIST in FIPS 180-4.* `SHA384` - The SHA-384 cryptographic hash, as defined by NIST in FIPS 180-4.* `SHA512` - The SHA-512 cryptographic hash, as defined by NIST in FIPS 180-4.* `SHA512_224` - The SHA-512/224 cryptographic hash, as defined by NIST in FIPS 180-4.* `SHA512_256` - The SHA-512/256 cryptographic hash, as defined by NIST in FIPS 180-4. 
* `is_never_expiring`:(bool) Used to mark the API key as a never-expiring API key. 
* `last_used_ip`:(string) The IP address from which the API key was last used. 
* `last_used_time`:(string) The time at which the API key was last used. It is updated every 24 hours. 
* `mod_time`:(string) The time when this managed object was last modified. 
* `moid`:(string) The unique identifier of this Managed Object instance. 
* `oper_status`:(string) The current status of the API key that dictates the validity of the key.* `enabled` - An API key/App Registration having enabled status can be used for API invocation.* `disabled` - An API key/App Registration having disabled status cannot be used for API invocation.* `expired` - An API key/App Registration having expired status cannot be used for API invocation as the expiration date has passed. 
* `private_key`:(string) Holds the private key for the API key. 
* `purpose`:(string) The purpose of the API Key. 
* `shared_scope`:(string) Intersight provides pre-built workflows, tasks and policies to end users through global catalogs.Objects that are made available through global catalogs are said to have a 'shared' ownership. Shared objects are either made globally available to all end users or restricted to end users based on their license entitlement. Users can use this property to differentiate the scope (global or a specific license tier) to which a shared MO belongs. 
* `signing_algorithm`:(string) The signing algorithm used by the client to authenticate API requests to Intersight.The signing algorithm must be compatible with the key generation specification.* `RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5` - RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5 is a RSA signature scheme specified in [RFC 8017](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8017).RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5 is included only for compatibility with existing applications.* `RSASSA-PSS` - RSASSA-PSS is a RSA signature scheme specified in [RFC 8017](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8017).It combines the RSASP1 and RSAVP1 primitives with the EMSA-PSS encoding method.In the interest of increased robustness, RSASSA-PSS is required in new applications.* `Ed25519` - The Ed25519 signature algorithm, as specified in [RFC 8032](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8032).Ed25519 is a public-key signature system with several attractive features, includingfast single-signature verification, very fast signing, fast key generation and high security level.* `Ecdsa` - The Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Standard (ECDSA), as defined by NIST in FIPS 186-4 and ANSI X9.62.The signature is encoded as a ASN.1 DER SEQUENCE with two INTEGERs (r and s), as defined in RFC3279.When using ECDSA signatures, configure the client to use the same signature encoding as specified on the server side.* `EcdsaP1363Format` - The Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Standard (ECDSA), as defined by NIST in FIPS 186-4 and ANSI X9.62.The signature is the raw concatenation of r and s, as defined in the ISO/IEC 7816-8 IEEE P.1363 standard.In that format, r and s are represented as unsigned, big endian numbers.Extra padding bytes (of value 0x00) is applied so that both r and s encodings have the same size.When using ECDSA signatures, configure the client to use the same signature encoding as specified on the server side. 
* `start_time`:(string) The timestamp at which an expiry date was first set on this API key. For expiring API keys, this field is same as the create time of the API key. For never-expiring API keys, this field is set initially to zero time value. If a never-expiry API key is later changed to have an expiration, the timestamp marking the start of this transition is recorded in this field.
