# Data Source: intersight_storage_pure_protection_group
Protection group entity in Pure storage array. A volume can be protected by associating with protection group either directly or indirectly (either host or host group). Snapshots are created on protected volume in local array or target array or both as per scheduler configuration.

The results of this data source are stored in `results` property.
All objects matching the filter criteria are fetched through pagination.
To access the ith object of the results obtained, use `data.intersight_storage_pure_protection_group.<custom_name>.results[i].<propertyname>`.

* `account_moid`:(string) The Account ID for this managed object. 
* `create_time`:(string) The time when this managed object was created. 
* `domain_group_moid`:(string) The DomainGroup ID for this managed object.

Shared objects are either made globally available to all end users or restricted to end users based on their license entitlement. Users can use this property to differentiate the scope (global or a specific license tier) to which a shared MO belongs. 
* `size`:(int) Overall size of all snapshots in the protection group, represented in bytes. 
* `snapshot_enabled`:(bool) Flag to determine if snapshot creation is enabled. Snapshots are created on local array if this flag is set.
