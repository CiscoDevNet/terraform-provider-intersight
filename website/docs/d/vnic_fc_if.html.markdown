# Data Source: intersight_vnic_fc_if
Virtual Fibre Channel Interface.
## Argument Reference
The results of this data source are stored in `results` property.
All objects matching the filter criteria are fetched through pagination.
To access the ith object of the results obtained, use `data.intersight_vnic_fc_if.<custom_name>.results[i].<propertyname>`.
The following arguments can be used to get data of already created objects in Intersight appliance:
* `account_moid`:(string) The Account ID for this managed object. 
* `create_time`:(string) The time when this managed object was created. 
* `domain_group_moid`:(string) The DomainGroup ID for this managed object. 
* `mod_time`:(string) The time when this managed object was last modified. 
* `moid`:(string) The unique identifier of this Managed Object instance. 
* `name`:(string) Name of the virtual fibre channel interface. 
* `order`:(int) The order in which the virtual interface is brought up. The order assigned to an interface should be unique for all the Ethernet and Fibre-Channel interfaces on each PCI link on a VIC adapter. The order should start from zero with no overlaps. The maximum value of PCI order is limited by the number of virtual interfaces (Ethernet and Fibre-Channel) on each PCI link on a VIC adapter. All VIC adapters have a single PCI link except VIC 1340, VIC 1380 and VIC 1385 which have two. 
* `persistent_bindings`:(bool) Enables retention of LUN ID associations in memory until they are manually cleared. 
* `pin_group_name`:(string) Pingroup name associated to vfc for static pinning. SCP deploy will resolve pingroup name and fetches the correspoding uplink port/port channel to pin the vfc traffic. 
* `shared_scope`:(string) Intersight provides pre-built workflows, tasks and policies to end users through global catalogs.Objects that are made available through global catalogs are said to have a 'shared' ownership. Shared objects are either made globally available to all end users or restricted to end users based on their license entitlement. Users can use this property to differentiate the scope (global or a specific license tier) to which a shared MO belongs. 
* `static_wwpn_address`:(string) The WWPN address must be in hexadecimal format xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx.Allowed ranges are 20:00:00:00:00:00:00:00 to 20:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF or from 50:00:00:00:00:00:00:00 to 5F:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF.To ensure uniqueness of WWN's in the SAN fabric, you are strongly encouraged to use the WWN prefix - 20:00:00:25:B5:xx:xx:xx. 
* `template_sync_status`:(string) The sync status of the current MO wrt the attached Template MO.* `None` - The Enum value represents that the object is not attached to any template.* `OK` - The Enum value represents that the object values are in sync with attached template.* `Scheduled` - The Enum value represents that the object sync from attached template is scheduled from template.* `InProgress` - The Enum value represents that the object sync with the attached template is in progress.* `OutOfSync` - The Enum value represents that the object values are not in sync with attached template. 
* `type`:(string) VHBA Type configuration for SAN Connectivity Policy. This configuration is supported only on Cisco VIC 14XX series and higher series of adapters.* `fc-initiator` - The default value set for vHBA Type Configuration. Fc-initiator specifies vHBA as a consumer of storage. Enables SCSI commands to transfer data and status information between host and target storage systems.* `fc-nvme-initiator` - Fc-nvme-initiator specifies vHBA as a consumer of storage. Enables NVMe-based message commands to transfer data and status information between host and target storage systems.* `fc-nvme-target` - Fc-nvme-target specifies vHBA as a provider of storage volumes to initiators. Enables NVMe-based message commands to transfer data and status information between host and target storage systems. Currently tech-preview, only enabled with an asynchronous driver.* `fc-target` - Fc-target specifies vHBA as a provider of storage volumes to initiators. Enables SCSI commands to transfer data and status information between host and target storage systems. fc-target is enabled only with an asynchronous driver. 
* `vif_id`:(int) This should be the same as the channel number of the vfc created on switch in order to set up the data path. The property is applicable only for FI attached servers where a vfc is created on the switch for every vHBA. 
* `wwpn`:(string) The WWPN address that is assigned to the vHBA based on the wwn pool that has been assigned to the SAN Connectivity Policy. 
* `wwpn_address_type`:(string) Type of allocation selected to assign a WWPN address to the vhba.* `POOL` - The user selects a pool from which the mac/wwn address will be leased for the Virtual Interface.* `STATIC` - The user assigns a static mac/wwn address for the Virtual Interface.
