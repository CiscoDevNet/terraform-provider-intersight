* `is_validate_request`:(bool) When this value is set to true, the task name validations happen and provides the task validation status against each of the selected API on the property selectedApis When this value is set to false, an internal workflow to generate the tasks is submitted,  conflicting task names are created with an incremented version. 
* `mod_time`:(string) The time when this managed object was last modified. 
* `moid`:(string) The unique identifier of this Managed Object instance. 
* `protocol`:(string) Specifies the REST API protocol being used, which can be one of HTTP or HTTPS.* `HTTPS` - Denotes that the API call uses the HTTPS protocol type* `HTTP` - Denotes that the API call uses the HTTP protocol type
