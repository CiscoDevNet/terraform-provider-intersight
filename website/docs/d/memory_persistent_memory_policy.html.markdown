# Data Source: intersight_memory_persistent_memory_policy
The Persistent Memory policy defines the reusable Persistent Memory related configuration that can be applied on many servers. This policy allows the application of Persistent Memory Goals and creation of Persistent Memory Regions and Namespaces. The encryption of the Persistent Memory Modules can be enabled through this policy by providing a passphrase.
## Argument Reference
The results of this data source are stored in `results` property.
All objects matching the filter criteria are fetched through pagination.
To access the ith object of the results obtained, use `data.intersight_memory_persistent_memory_policy.<custom_name>.results[i].<propertyname>`.
The following arguments can be used to get data of already created objects in Intersight appliance:
* `account_moid`:(string) The Account ID for this managed object. 
* `create_time`:(string) The time when this managed object was created. 
* `description`:(string) Description of the policy. 
* `domain_group_moid`:(string) The DomainGroup ID for this managed object. 
* `management_mode`:(string) Management Mode of the policy. This can be either Configured from Intersight or Configured from Operating System.* `configured-from-intersight` - The Persistent Memory Modules are configured from Intersight thorugh Persistent Memory policy.* `configured-from-operating-system` - The Persistent Memory Modules are configured from operating system thorugh OS tools. 
* `mod_time`:(string) The time when this managed object was last modified. 
* `moid`:(string) The unique identifier of this Managed Object instance. 
* `name`:(string) Name of the concrete policy. 
* `retain_namespaces`:(bool) Persistent Memory Namespaces to be retained or not. 
* `shared_scope`:(string) Intersight provides pre-built workflows, tasks and policies to end users through global catalogs.Objects that are made available through global catalogs are said to have a 'shared' ownership. Shared objects are either made globally available to all end users or restricted to end users based on their license entitlement. Users can use this property to differentiate the scope (global or a specific license tier) to which a shared MO belongs.
