# Data Source: intersight_virtualization_iwe_host
A Intersight Workload Engine compute host entity that is part of HyperFlex compute cluster and probably runs VMs.
## Argument Reference
The results of this data source are stored in `results` property.
All objects matching the filter criteria are fetched through pagination.
To access the ith object of the results obtained, use `data.intersight_virtualization_iwe_host.<custom_name>.results[i].<propertyname>`.
The following arguments can be used to get data of already created objects in Intersight appliance:
* `account_moid`:(string) The Account ID for this managed object. 
* `age`:(string) Denotes age or life time of the Host in nano seconds. 
* `chassis_version`:(string) Chassis version of the Host. 
* `cluster_uuid`:(string) The UUID of the cluster to which this Host belongs to. 
* `create_time`:(string) The time when this managed object was created. 
* `domain_group_moid`:(string) The DomainGroup ID for this managed object. 
* `failure_reason`:(string) Reason of the failure when host is in failed state. 
* `hw_power_state`:(string) Is the host Powered-up or Powered-down.* `Unknown` - The entity's power state is unknown.* `PoweringOn` - The entity is powering on.* `PoweredOn` - The entity is powered on.* `PoweringOff` - The entity is powering off.* `PoweredOff` - The entity is powered down.* `StandBy` - The entity is in standby mode.* `Paused` - The entity is in pause state.* `Rebooting` - The entity reboot is in progress.* `` - The entity's power state is not available. 
* `hypervisor_type`:(string) Identifies the broad type of the underlying hypervisor.* `ESXi` - The hypervisor running on the HyperFlex cluster is a Vmware ESXi hypervisor of any version.* `HyperFlexAp` - The hypervisor of the virtualization platform is Cisco HyperFlex Application Platform.* `IWE` - The hypervisor of the virtualization platform is Cisco Intersight Workload Engine.* `Hyper-V` - The hypervisor running on the HyperFlex cluster is Microsoft Hyper-V.* `Unknown` - The hypervisor running on the HyperFlex cluster is not known. 
* `identity`:(string) The internally generated identity of this host. This entity is not manipulated by users. It aids in uniquely identifying the datacenter object. For VMware, this is an MOR (managed object reference). 
* `internal_ip_address`:(string) Internal IP Address of the Host. 
* `maintenance_mode`:(bool) Is this host in maintenance mode. Set to true or false. 
* `management_ip_address`:(string) Management IP Address of the Host. 
* `master_role`:(bool) Is the role of this host is master in the cluster? true or false. 
* `mod_time`:(string) The time when this managed object was last modified. 
* `model`:(string) Commercial model information about this hardware. 
* `moid`:(string) The unique identifier of this Managed Object instance. 
* `name`:(string) Name of this host supplied by user. It is not the identity of the host. The name is subject to user manipulations. 
* `serial`:(string) Serial number of this host (internally generated). 
* `shared_scope`:(string) Intersight provides pre-built workflows, tasks and policies to end users through global catalogs.Objects that are made available through global catalogs are said to have a 'shared' ownership. Shared objects are either made globally available to all end users or restricted to end users based on their license entitlement. Users can use this property to differentiate the scope (global or a specific license tier) to which a shared MO belongs. 
* `status`:(string) Host health status, as reported by the hypervisor platform.* `Unknown` - Entity status is unknown.* `Degraded` - State is degraded, and might impact normal operation of the entity.* `Critical` - Entity is in a critical state, impacting operations.* `Ok` - Entity status is in a stable state, operating normally. 
* `storage_vm_power_state`:(string) Is the Storage Controller VM on the host Powered-up or Powered-down.* `Unknown` - The entity's power state is unknown.* `PoweringOn` - The entity is powering on.* `PoweredOn` - The entity is powered on.* `PoweringOff` - The entity is powering off.* `PoweredOff` - The entity is powered down.* `StandBy` - The entity is in standby mode.* `Paused` - The entity is in pause state.* `Rebooting` - The entity reboot is in progress.* `` - The entity's power state is not available. 
* `up_time`:(string) The uptime of the host, stored as Duration (from w3c). 
* `uuid`:(string) Universally unique identity of this host (example b3d4483b-5560-9342-8309-b486c9236610). Internally generated. 
* `vendor`:(string) Commercial vendor details of this hardware. 
* `nr_version`:(string) Product version of the Host.
