# Data Source: intersight_storage_net_app_base_disk
NetApp base disk is a storage array disk.
## Argument Reference
The results of this data source are stored in `results` property.
All objects matching the filter criteria are fetched through pagination.
To access the ith object of the results obtained, use `data.intersight_storage_net_app_base_disk.<custom_name>.results[i].<propertyname>`.
The following arguments can be used to get data of already created objects in Intersight appliance:

* `disk_shelf_name`:(string) NetApp base disk shelf name. 
* `disk_type`:(string) The type of the NetApp disk.* `Unknown` - Default unknown disk type.* `SSDNVM` - Solid state disk with Non-Volatile Memory Express protocol enabled.* `ATA` - Advanced Technology Attachment is a type of disk drive that integrates the drive controller directly on the drive itself.* `FCAL` - For the FC-AL disk connection type, disk shelves are connected to the controller in a loop.* `BSAS` - Bridged SAS-SATA disks with added hardware to enable them to be plugged into a SAS-connected storage shelf.* `FSAS` - Near Line SAS. NL-SAS drives are enterprise SATA drives with a SAS interface, head, media, and rotational speed of traditional enterprise-class SATA drives with the fully capable SAS interface typical for classic SAS drives.* `LUN` - Logical Unit Number refers to a logical disk.* `SAS` - Storage disk with serial attached SCSI.* `MSATA` - SATA disk in multi-disk carrier storage shelf.* `SSD` - Storage disk with Solid state disk.* `VMDISK` - Virtual machine Data Disk. 
* `dn`:(string) The Distinguished Name unambiguously identifies an object in the system. 
* `domain_group_moid`:(string) The DomainGroup ID for this managed object. 
* `is_upgraded`:(bool) This field indicates the compute status of the catalog values for the associated component or hardware. 
* `mod_time`:(string) The time when this managed object was last modified. 
* `model`:(string) This field displays the model number of the associated component or hardware. 
* `moid`:(string) The unique identifier of this Managed Object instance. 
* `name`:(string) Disk name available in storage array. 
* `node_name`:(string) The node name for the disk. 
* `part_number`:(string) Storage disk part number. 
* `presence`:(string) This field indicates the presence (equipped) or absence (absent) of the associated component or hardware. 
* `protocol`:(string) Storage protocol used in disk for communication. Possible values are SAS, SATA and NVMe.* `Unknown` - Disk protocol is unknown.* `SAS` - Serial Attached SCSI protocol (SAS) used in disk.* `NVMe` - Non-volatile memory express (NVMe) protocol used in disk.* `SATA` - Serial Advanced Technology Attachment (SATA) used in disk. 
* `revision`:(string) This field displays the revised version of the associated component or hardware (if any). 
* `rn`:(string) The Relative Name uniquely identifies an object within a given context. 
* `serial`:(string) This field displays the serial number of the associated component or hardware. 
* `shared_scope`:(string) Intersight provides pre-built workflows, tasks and policies to end users through global catalogs.Objects that are made available through global catalogs are said to have a 'shared' ownership. Shared objects are either made globally available to all end users or restricted to end users based on their license entitlement. Users can use this property to differentiate the scope (global or a specific license tier) to which a shared MO belongs. 
* `speed`:(int) Disk speed for read or write operation measured in rpm. 
* `state`:(string) Current state of the NetApp disk.* `Present` - Storage disk state type is present.* `Copy` - Storage disk state type is copy.* `Broken` - Storage disk state type is broken.* `Maintenance` - Storage disk state type is maintenance.* `Partner` - Storage disk state type is partner.* `Pending` - Storage disk state type is pending.* `Reconstructing` - Storage disk state type is reconstructing.* `Removed` - Storage disk state type is removed.* `Spare` - Storage disk state type is spare.* `Unfail` - Storage disk state type is unfail.* `Zeroing` - Storage disk state type is zeroing. 
* `status`:(string) Storage disk health status.* `Unknown` - Component status is not available.* `Ok` - Component is healthy and no issues found.* `Degraded` - Functioning, but not at full capability due to a non-fatal failure.* `Critical` - Not functioning or requiring immediate attention.* `Offline` - Component is installed, but powered off.* `Identifying` - Component is in initialization process.* `NotAvailable` - Component is not installed or not available.* `Updating` - Software update is in progress.* `Unrecognized` - Component is not recognized.
