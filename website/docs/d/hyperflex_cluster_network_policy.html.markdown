# Data Source: intersight_hyperflex_cluster_network_policy
A policy specifying VLANs for management, VM migration, and VM traffic.
## Argument Reference
The results of this data source are stored in `results` property.
All objects matching the filter criteria are fetched through pagination.
To access the ith object of the results obtained, use `data.intersight_hyperflex_cluster_network_policy.<custom_name>.results[i].<propertyname>`.
The following arguments can be used to get data of already created objects in Intersight appliance:
* `account_moid`:(string) The Account ID for this managed object. 
* `cimc_management_mode`:(string) The mode configured on the CIMC management interface.* `OutOfBand` - The server uses out-of-band management, i.e. management traffic traverses through the management interfaces on the UCS Fabric Interconnects.* `InBand` - The server uses in-band management, i.e. management traffic traverses through the data uplink ports on the UCS Fabric Interconnects. 
* `create_time`:(string) The time when this managed object was created. 
* `description`:(string) Description of the policy. 
* `domain_group_moid`:(string) The DomainGroup ID for this managed object. 
* `jumbo_frame`:(bool) Enable or disable Jumbo Frames (MTU=9000). Jumbo Frames are used by Storage Network, VM Migration Network. 
* `mod_time`:(string) The time when this managed object was last modified. 
* `moid`:(string) The unique identifier of this Managed Object instance. 
* `name`:(string) Name of the concrete policy. 
* `shared_scope`:(string) Intersight provides pre-built workflows, tasks and policies to end users through global catalogs.Objects that are made available through global catalogs are said to have a 'shared' ownership. Shared objects are either made globally available to all end users or restricted to end users based on their license entitlement. Users can use this property to differentiate the scope (global or a specific license tier) to which a shared MO belongs. 
* `uplink_speed`:(string) Link speed of the server adapter port to the upstream switch. When the policy is attached to a cluster profile with EDGE management platform, the uplink speed can be '1G' or '10G+'. Use '10G+' for link speeds of 10G or above. When the policy is attached to a cluster profile with Fabric Interconnect management platform, the uplink speed can be 'default' only.* `default` - Current default value set on the hardware platform.* `1G` - A link speed of 1 gigabit per second.* `10G` - A link speed of 10 gigabits per second or above.
