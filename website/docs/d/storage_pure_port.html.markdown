* `account_moid`:(string) The Account ID for this managed object. 
* `create_time`:(string) The time when this managed object was created. 
* `domain_group_moid`:(string) The DomainGroup ID for this managed object. 
* `failover`:(string) Name of the port to which this port has failed over. 
* `iqn`:(string) ISCSI qualified name applicable for ethernet port. Example - 'iqn.2008-05.com.storage:fnm00151300643-514f0c50141faf05'. 
* `mod_time`:(string) The time when this managed object was last modified. 
* `moid`:(string) The unique identifier of this Managed Object instance. 
* `name`:(string) Name of the physical port available in storage array. 
* `nqn`:(string) The NVMe Qualified Name (NQN) associated with the host for ethernet port. 
* `portal`:(string) Ip address of iSCSI portal configured on the port. 
* `shared_scope`:(string) Intersight provides pre-built workflows, tasks and policies to end users through global catalogs.Objects that are made available through global catalogs are said to have a 'shared' ownership.

* `speed`:(int) Operational speed of physical port measured in Gbps. 
* `status`:(string) Status of storage array port.* `Unknown` - Component status is not available.* `Ok` - Component is healthy and no issues found.* `Degraded` - Functioning, but not at full capability due to a non-fatal failure.* `Critical` - Not functioning or requiring immediate attention.* `Offline` - Component is installed, but powered off.* `Identifying` - Component is in initialization process.* `NotAvailable` - Component is not installed or not available.* `Updating` - Software update is in progress.* `Unrecognized` - Component is not recognized.
