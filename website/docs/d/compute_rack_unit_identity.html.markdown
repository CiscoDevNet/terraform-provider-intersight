# Data Source: intersight_compute_rack_unit_identity
Identity object that uniquely represents a server object under a DR.
## Argument Reference
The results of this data source are stored in `results` property.
All objects matching the filter criteria are fetched through pagination.
To access the ith object of the results obtained, use `data.intersight_compute_rack_unit_identity.<custom_name>.results[i].<propertyname>`.
The following arguments can be used to get data of already created objects in Intersight appliance:
* `account_moid`:(string) The Account ID for this managed object. 
* `adapter_serial`:(string) Serial Identifier of an adapter participating in SWM. 
* `admin_action`:(string) Updated by UI/API to trigger specific chassis action type.* `None` - No operation value for maintenance actions on an equipment.* `Decommission` - Decommission the equipment and temporarily remove it from being managed by Intersight.* `Recommission` - Recommission the equipment.* `Reack` - Reacknowledge the equipment and discover it again.* `Remove` - Remove the equipment permanently from Intersight management.* `Replace` - Replace the equipment with the other one. 
* `admin_action_state`:(string) The state of Maintenance Action performed. This will have three states. Applying - Action is in progress. Applied - Action is completed and applied. Failed - Action has failed.* `None` - Nil value when no action has been triggered by the user.* `Applied` - User configured settings are in applied state.* `Applying` - User settings are being applied on the target server.* `Failed` - User configured settings could not be applied. 
* `create_time`:(string) The time when this managed object was created. 
* `domain_group_moid`:(string) The DomainGroup ID for this managed object. 
* `identifier`:(int) Numeric Identifier assigned by the management system to the equipment. 
* `nr_lifecycle`:(string) The equipment's lifecycle status.* `None` - Default state of an equipment. This should be an initial state when no state is defined for an equipment.* `Active` - Default Lifecycle State for a physical entity.* `Decommissioned` - Decommission Lifecycle state.* `DecommissionInProgress` - Decommission Inprogress Lifecycle state.* `RecommissionInProgress` - Recommission Inprogress Lifecycle state.* `OperationFailed` - Failed Operation Lifecycle state.* `ReackInProgress` - ReackInProgress Lifecycle state.* `RemoveInProgress` - RemoveInProgress Lifecycle state.* `Discovered` - Discovered Lifecycle state.* `DiscoveryInProgress` - DiscoveryInProgress Lifecycle state.* `DiscoveryFailed` - DiscoveryFailed Lifecycle state.* `FirmwareUpgradeInProgress` - Firmware upgrade is in progress on given physical entity.* `BladeMigrationInProgress` - Server slot migration is in progress on given physical entity.* `Inactive` - Inactive Lifecycle state.* `ReplaceInProgress` - ReplaceInProgress Lifecycle state.* `SlotMismatch` - The blade server is detected in a different chassis/slot than it was previously. 
* `mod_time`:(string) The time when this managed object was last modified. 
* `model`:(string) The vendor provided model name for the equipment. 
* `moid`:(string) The unique identifier of this Managed Object instance. 
* `serial`:(string) The serial number of the equipment. 
* `shared_scope`:(string) Intersight provides pre-built workflows, tasks and policies to end users through global catalogs.Objects that are made available through global catalogs are said to have a 'shared' ownership. Shared objects are either made globally available to all end users or restricted to end users based on their license entitlement.
