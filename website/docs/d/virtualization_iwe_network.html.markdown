All objects matching the filter criteria are fetched through pagination.
To access the ith object of the results obtained, use `data.intersight_virtualization_iwe_network.<custom_name>.results[i].<propertyname>`.
The following arguments can be used to get data of already created objects in Intersight appliance:
* `account_moid`:(string) The Account ID for this managed object. 
* `create_time`:(string) The time when this managed object was created. 
* `domain_group_moid`:(string) The DomainGroup ID for this managed object.

* `infra_network`:(bool) A flag to distinguish if a network belongs to a HxAp infrastructure network or a user defined network that guest workloads can use. 
* `mod_time`:(string) The time when this managed object was last modified. 
* `moid`:(string) The unique identifier of this Managed Object instance. 
* `mtu`:(int) The MTU size of the network. 
* `name`:(string) User-provided name to identify the portgroup. 
* `network_type`:(string) Network attachment type, only \ L2\  is available now.* `unknown` - This network is of an unknown network type.* `L2` - A Layer 2 switching network type. 
* `shared_scope`:(string) Intersight provides pre-built workflows, tasks and policies to end users through global catalogs.Objects that are made available through global catalogs are said to have a 'shared' ownership.
