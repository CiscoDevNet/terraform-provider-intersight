# Resource: intersight_config_exporter
All export operations are captured as Exporter instances. Users shall use this Exporter
mo to track the export operation progress.
## Argument Reference
The following arguments are supported:
* `account_moid`:(string)(Computed) The Account ID for this managed object. 
* `ancestors`:(Array)(Computed) An array of relationships to moBaseMo resources. 
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `moid`:(string)(Computed) The Moid of the referenced REST resource. 
  + `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the remote type referred by this relationship. 
  + `selector`:(string)(Computed) An OData $filter expression which describes the REST resource to be referenced. This field maybe set instead of 'moid' by clients.1. If 'moid' is set this field is ignored.1. If 'selector' is set and 'moid' is empty/absent from the request, Intersight determines the Moid of theresource matching the filter expression and populates it in the MoRef that is part of the objectinstance being inserted/updated to fulfill the REST request.An error is returned if the filter matches zero or more than one REST resource.An example filter string is: Serial eq '3AA8B7T11'. 
* `create_time`:(string)(Computed) The time when this managed object was created. 
* `domain_group_moid`:(string)(Computed) The DomainGroup ID for this managed object. 
* `download_path`:(string)(Computed) Pre-signed URL to download the exported package, if the export operation has completed successfully. Regenerated during a GET request, if the existing pre-signed URL has expired. 
* `exported_items`:(Array)(Computed) An array of relationships to configExportedItem resources. 
This complex property has following sub-properties:

  + `selector`:(string)(Computed) An OData $filter expression which describes the REST resource to be referenced. This field maybe set instead of 'moid' by clients.1. If 'moid' is set this field is ignored.1. If 'selector' is set and 'moid' is empty/absent from the request, Intersight determines the Moid of theresource matching the filter expression and populates it in the MoRef that is part of the objectinstance being inserted/updated to fulfill the REST request.An error is returned if the filter matches zero or more than one REST resource.An example filter string is: Serial eq '3AA8B7T11'. 
* `items`:(Array)
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `moid`:(string) Moid represents the MoId of the object. 
  + `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type.The value should be the same as the 'ClassId' property.

If 'moid' is set this field is ignored.1. If 'selector' is set and 'moid' is empty/absent from the request, Intersight determines the Moid of theresource matching the filter expression and populates it in the MoRef that is part of the objectinstance being inserted/updated to fulfill the REST request.An error is returned if the filter matches zero or more than one REST resource.An example filter string is: Serial eq '3AA8B7T11'.
