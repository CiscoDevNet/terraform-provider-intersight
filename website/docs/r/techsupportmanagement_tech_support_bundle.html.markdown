  A request to collect techsupport and upload it to Intersight Storage Service. The serial number, PID and/or relationship to the target resource provided by the user is used to determine the device type for techsupport collection. If the serial number, PID and target resource are specified in the request, the values must match. Valid values of device types are network.Element for fabric interconnect, compute.Blade for blade server, compute.RackUnit for rack server, equipment.Chassis for chassis, equipment.IoCard for IO Module, equipment.FEX for fabric extender and adapter.Unit for network adapter. UCSM techsupport is collected for device type network.Element. Chassis techsupport is collected for compute.Blade, equipment.Chassis, equipment.IoCard, and blade adapter.Unit. Server techsupport is collected for compute.RackUnit and rack adapter.Unit. Fabric extender techsupport is collected for device type equipment.FEX. Hyper Flex node level techsupport is collected when the request specifies the platform type (HX) and the device type is Hyperflex.Node.

# Resource: intersight_techsupportmanagement_tech_support_bundle
A request to collect techsupport and upload it to Intersight Storage Service. The serial number, PID and/or relationship to the target resource provided by the user is used to determine the device type for techsupport collection. If the serial number, PID and target resource are specified in the request, the values must match. Valid values of device types are network.Element for fabric interconnect, compute.Blade for blade server, compute.RackUnit for rack server, equipment.Chassis for chassis, equipment.IoCard for IO Module, equipment.FEX for fabric extender and adapter.Unit for network adapter. UCSM techsupport is collected for device type network.Element. Chassis techsupport is collected for compute.Blade, equipment.Chassis, equipment.IoCard, and blade adapter.Unit. Server techsupport is collected for compute.RackUnit and rack adapter.Unit. Fabric extender techsupport is collected for device type equipment.FEX. Hyper Flex node level techsupport is collected when the request specifies the platform type (HX) and the device type is Hyperflex.Node.
## Usage Example
### Resource Creation

```hcl
resource "intersight_techsupportmanagement_tech_support_bundle" "techsupportmanagement_tech_support_bundle" {
  platform_type = "UCSD"
  target_resource = {
    object_type   = "techsupportmanagement.TechSupportBundle"
    platform_type = "UCSD"
  }
  device_registration {
    moid        = var.asset.deviceRegistration

## Argument Reference
The following arguments are supported:

This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `moid`:(string) The Moid of the referenced REST resource. 
  + `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the remote type referred by this relationship. 
  + `selector`:(string) An OData $filter expression which describes the REST resource to be referenced. This field maybe set instead of 'moid' by clients.1. If 'moid' is set this field is ignored.1. If 'selector' is set and 'moid' is empty/absent from the request, Intersight determines the Moid of theresource matching the filter expression and populates it in the MoRef that is part of the objectinstance being inserted/updated to fulfill the REST request.An error is returned if the filter matches zero or more than one REST resource.An example filter string is: Serial eq '3AA8B7T11'.
