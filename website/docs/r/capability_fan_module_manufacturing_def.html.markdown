# Resource: intersight_capability_fan_module_manufacturing_def
Fan module unit that contains multiple fans.
## Usage Example
### Resource Creation

```hcl
resource "intersight_capability_fan_module_manufacturing_def" "capability_fan_module_manufacturing_def1" {
  caption      = "Cisco UCS S3260 Fan"
  description  = "Cisco UCS S3260 Fan module containing 2x80mm fans FRU"
  name         = "fan1"
  pid          = "UCSC-C3X60-FANM"
  product_name = "Cisco UCS S3260 Fan module"
  sku          = "UCSC-C3X60-FANM"
  vid          = "V01"
}
```
## Argument Reference
The following arguments are supported:
* `account_moid`:(string)(Computed) The Account ID for this managed object. 
* `ancestors`:(Array)(Computed) An array of relationships to moBaseMo resources. 
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `moid`:(string) The Moid of the referenced REST resource. 
  + `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the remote type referred by this relationship. 
  + `selector`:(string) An OData $filter expression which describes the REST resource to be referenced. This field maybe set instead of 'moid' by clients.1. If 'moid' is set this field is ignored.1. If 'selector' is set and 'moid' is empty/absent from the request, Intersight determines the Moid of theresource matching the filter expression and populates it in the MoRef that is part of the objectinstance being inserted/updated to fulfill the REST request.An error is returned if the filter matches zero or more than one REST resource.An example filter string is: Serial eq '3AA8B7T11'. 
* `caption`:(string) Caption for a fan module. 
* `create_time`:(string)(Computed) The time when this managed object was created. 
* `description`:(string) Description for a fan module. 
* `domain_group_moid`:(string)(Computed) The DomainGroup ID for this managed object. 
* `mod_time`:(string)(Computed) The time when this managed object was last modified. 
* `moid`:(string) The unique identifier of this Managed Object instance. 
* `name`:(string) An unique identifer for a capability descriptor. 
* `owners`:
                (Array of schema.TypeString) -(Computed)
* `parent`:(HashMap) -(Computed) A reference to a moBaseMo resource.When the $expand query parameter is specified, the referenced resource is returned inline.

* `pid`:(string) Product Identifier for a fan module. 
* `product_name`:(string) Product Name for Fan Module Unit. 
* `shared_scope`:(string)(Computed) Intersight provides pre-built workflows, tasks and policies to end users through global catalogs.Objects that are made available through global catalogs are said to have a 'shared' ownership. Shared objects are either made globally available to all end users or restricted to end users based on their license entitlement. Users can use this property to differentiate the scope (global or a specific license tier) to which a shared MO belongs. 
* `sku`:(string) SKU information for a fan module. 
* `tags`:(Array)
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `key`:(string) The string representation of a tag key. 
  + `value`:(string) The string representation of a tag value. 
* `version_context`:(HashMap) -(Computed) The versioning info for this managed object. 
This complex property has following sub-properties:

This complex property has following sub-properties:
    + `moid`:(string) The Moid of the referenced REST resource. 
    + `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the remote type referred by this relationship. 
    + `selector`:(string) An OData $filter expression which describes the REST resource to be referenced. This field maybe set instead of 'moid' by clients.1. If 'moid' is set this field is ignored.1. If 'selector' is set and 'moid' is empty/absent from the request, Intersight determines the Moid of theresource matching the filter expression and populates it in the MoRef that is part of the objectinstance being inserted/updated to fulfill the REST request.An error is returned if the filter matches zero or more than one REST resource.An example filter string is: Serial eq '3AA8B7T11'. 
  + `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type.The value should be the same as the 'ClassId' property. 
  + `ref_mo`:(HashMap) -(Computed) A reference to the original Managed Object.
