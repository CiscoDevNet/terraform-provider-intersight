# Resource: intersight_hyperflex_node_profile
A configuration profile per node in the HyperFlex cluster.
It defines node settings such as IP address configuration for hypervisor management network, storage data network, HyperFlex management network, and the assigned physical server.
## Usage Example
### Resource Creation

```hcl
resource "intersight_hyperflex_node_profile" "hyperflex_node_profile1" {
  description = "This is hyperflex_node_profile1"
  assigned_server {
    moid        = intersight_hyperflex_cluster_profile.hyperflex_cluster_profile1.moid
    object_type = "compute.RackUnit"
  }
  cluster_profile {
    moid        = intersight_hyperflex_cluster_profile.hyperflex_cluster_profile1.moid
    object_type = "hyperflex.ClusterProfile"
  }
  name = "ucsback-10G-3nodehx-cluster-NP1"
}

* `action`:(string) User initiated action. Each profile type has its own supported actions. For HyperFlex cluster profile, the supported actions are -- Validate, Deploy, Continue, Retry, Abort, Unassign For server profile, the support actions are -- Deploy, Unassign. 
* `action_params`:(Array)
This complex property has following sub-properties:
