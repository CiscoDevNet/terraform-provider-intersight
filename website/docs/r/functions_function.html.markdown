# Resource: intersight_functions_function
The managed object which has info about custom function to be built and deployed.
## Argument Reference
The following arguments are supported:
* `account_moid`:(string)(ReadOnly) The Account ID for this managed object. 
* `action`:(string) Action of the function such as build, deploy, undeploy, delete.* `None` - No action is set, this is the default value for action field.* `Build` - Build an instance of a Function.* `Deploy` - Deploy the build Function.* `Undeploy` - Undeploy a Function that was previously successfully deployed.* `Delete` - Delete a Function that has yet to be deployed or that was recently undeployed. 
* `action_execution`:(HashMap) - A reference to a workflowWorkflowInfo resource.When the $expand query parameter is specified, the referenced resource is returned inline. 
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `moid`:(string) The Moid of the referenced REST resource. 
  + `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the remote type referred by this relationship. 
  + `selector`:(string) An OData $filter expression which describes the REST resource to be referenced. This field maybe set instead of 'moid' by clients.1. If 'moid' is set this field is ignored.1. If 'selector' is set and 'moid' is empty/absent from the request, Intersight determines the Moid of theresource matching the filter expression and populates it in the MoRef that is part of the objectinstance being inserted/updated to fulfill the REST request.An error is returned if the filter matches zero or more than one REST resource.An example filter string is: Serial eq '3AA8B7T11'.
