# Resource: intersight_bulk_request
The bulk.Request API allows users to perform API actions (Create, Update or Delete) in bulk, on a given URI.
It is possible to operate on multiple subpaths relative to the provided URI (For example, it would be possible to
perform a PATCH action on multiple objects of a given REST resource type).
## Argument Reference
The following arguments are supported:
* `account_moid`:(string)(ReadOnly) The Account ID for this managed object. 
* `action_on_error`:(string) The action to be taken when an error occurs during processing of the request.* `Stop` - Stop the processing of the request after the first error.* `Proceed` - Proceed with the processing of the request even when an error occurs. 
* `actions`:
                (Array of schema.TypeString) -
* `ancestors`:(Array)(ReadOnly) An array of relationships to moBaseMo resources. 
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `moid`:(string) The Moid of the referenced REST resource. 
  + `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the remote type referred by this relationship. 
  + `selector`:(string) An OData $filter expression which describes the REST resource to be referenced. This field maybe set instead of 'moid' by clients.1. If 'moid' is set this field is ignored.1. If 'selector' is set and 'moid' is empty/absent from the request, Intersight determines the Moid of theresource matching the filter expression and populates it in the MoRef that is part of the objectinstance being inserted/updated to fulfill the REST request.An error is returned if the filter matches zero or more than one REST resource.An example filter string is: Serial eq '3AA8B7T11'.
