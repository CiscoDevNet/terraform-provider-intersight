# Resource: intersight_memory_persistent_memory_policy
The Persistent Memory policy defines the reusable Persistent Memory related configuration that can be applied on many servers. This policy allows the application of Persistent Memory Goals and creation of Persistent Memory Regions and Namespaces. The encryption of the Persistent Memory Modules can be enabled through this policy by providing a passphrase.
## Usage Example
### Resource Creation

```hcl
resource "intersight_memory_persistent_memory_policy" "memory_persistent_memory_policy1" {
  name        = "memory_persistent_memory_policy1"
  description = "memory persistent memory policies"
  goals {
    object_type            = "memory.PersistentMemoryGoal"
    persistent_memory_type = "app-direct-non-interleaved"
    socket_id              = "All Sockets"
    class_id               = "memory.PersistentMemoryGoal"
    memory_mode_percentage = 50
  }
  local_security {
    object_type       = "memory.PersistentMemoryLocalSecurity"
    enabled           = true
    secure_passphrase = "ChangeMe"
  }
  logical_namespaces {
    class_id         = "memory.PersistentMemoryLocalSecurity"
    name             = "logical_namespace_test"
    capacity         = 131072
    object_type      = "memory.PersistentMemoryLocalSecurity"
    mode             = "block"
    socket_id        = 1
    socket_memory_id = 6
  }
  management_mode   = "configured-from-intersight"
  retain_namespaces = false
  organization {
    object_type = "organization.Organization"
    moid        = var.organization
  }
}
```
## Argument Reference
The following arguments are supported:
* `account_moid`:(string)(ReadOnly) The Account ID for this managed object. 
* `ancestors`:(Array)(ReadOnly) An array of relationships to moBaseMo resources. 
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `moid`:(string) The Moid of the referenced REST resource. 
  + `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the remote type referred by this relationship.
