# Resource: intersight_fabric._fcoe_uplink_role
Configuration object sent by user to create a fcoe uplink port.
## Argument Reference
The following arguments are supported:
* `additional_properties`:
(Array with Maximum of one item) - Add additional properties in json format inside `jsonencode()` for this object.
* `admin_speed`:(string) Admin configured speed for the port.* `Auto` - Admin configurable speed AUTO ( default ).* `1Gbps` - Admin configurable speed 1Gbps.* `10Gbps` - Admin configurable speed 10Gbps.* `25Gbps` - Admin configurable speed 25Gbps.* `40Gbps` - Admin configurable speed 40Gbps.* `100Gbps` - Admin configurable speed 100Gbps. 
* `aggregate_port_id`:(int) Breakout port Identifier of the Switch Interface. 
* `class_id`:(string)(Computed) The concrete type of this complex type. Its value must be the same as the 'objectType' property.The OpenAPI document references this property as a discriminator value. 
* `fec`:(string) Forward error correction configuration for the port.* `Auto` - Forward error correction option 'Auto'.* `Cl91` - Forward error correction option 'cl91'.* `Cl74` - Forward error correction option 'cl74'. 
* `moid`:(string) The unique identifier of this Managed Object instance. 
* `object_type`:(string)(Computed) The fully-qualified type of this managed object, i.e. the class name.This property is optional. The ObjectType is implied from the URL path.If specified, the value of objectType must match the class name specified in the URL path. 
* `port_id`:(int) Port Identifier of the Switch/FEX/Chassis Interface. 
* `port_policy`:(Array with Maximum of one item) - A reference to a fabricPortPolicy resource.When the $expand query parameter is specified, the referenced resource is returned inline. 
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `additional_properties`:
(Array with Maximum of one item) - Add additional properties in json format inside `jsonencode()` for this object.
  + `class_id`:(string)(Computed) The concrete type of this complex type. Its value must be the same as the 'objectType' property.The OpenAPI document references this property as a discriminator value. 
  + `moid`:(string)(Computed) The Moid of the referenced REST resource. 
  + `object_type`:(string) The concrete type of this complex type.The ObjectType property must be set explicitly by API clients when the type is ambiguous. In all other cases, the ObjectType is optional. The type is ambiguous when a managed object contains an array of nested documents, and the documents in the arrayare heterogeneous, i.e. the array can contain nested documents of different types. 
  + `selector`:(string)(Computed) An OData $filter expression which describes the REST resource to be referenced. This field maybe set instead of 'moid' by clients.1. If 'moid' is set this field is ignored.1. If 'selector' is set and 'moid' is empty/absent from the request, Intersight determines the Moid of theresource matching the filter expression and populates it in the MoRef that is part of the objectinstance being inserted/updated to fulfill the REST request.An error is returned if the filter matches zero or more than one REST resource.An example filter string is: Serial eq '3AA8B7T11'. 
* `slot_id`:(int) Slot Identifier of the Switch/FEX/Chassis Interface. 
* `tags`:(Array)
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `additional_properties`:
(Array with Maximum of one item) - Add additional properties in json format inside `jsonencode()` for this object.
  + `key`:(string) The string representation of a tag key. 
  + `value`:(string) The string representation of a tag value. 
* `udld_admin_state`:(string) Admin configured state for UDLD for this port.* `Disabled` - Admin configured Disabled State.* `Enabled` - Admin configured Enabled State.
