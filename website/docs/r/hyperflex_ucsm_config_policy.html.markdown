A policy specifying UCS Manager settings such as service profile org, KVM IP addresses, and MAC prefix for server configuration in Fabric Interconnect environment.
## Usage Example
### Resource Creation

```hcl
resource "intersight_hyperflex_ucsm_config_policy" "hyperflex_ucsm_config_policy1" {
  name        = "hyperflex_ucsm_config_policy1"
  description = "hyperflex ucsm configuration policy"

## Argument Reference
The following arguments are supported:
* `account_moid`:(string)(ReadOnly) The Account ID for this managed object. 
* `ancestors`:(Array)(ReadOnly) An array of relationships to moBaseMo resources. 
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `moid`:(string) The Moid of the referenced REST resource. 
  + `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the remote type referred by this relationship.
