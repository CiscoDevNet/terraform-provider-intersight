        Data Export Policy is a category-based data collection policy that enables or disables
        data export (data collection) from the Intersight Appliance to the Intersight. The Data
        Export Policy configuration is organized hierarchically as follows.
        Global:
        Inventory:
        Network
        Storage
        TechSupport
        When the DataExportPolicy for a category is enabled/disabled, all the sub-category configurations
        are enabled/disabled as well. For example, if you enable/disable Inventory, all its sub-category
        configurations (ie. Network and Storage) are also enabled/disabled.

# Resource: intersight_appliance_data_export_policy
Data Export Policy is a category-based data collection policy that enables or disables
data export (data collection) from the Intersight Appliance to the Intersight. The Data
Export Policy configuration is organized hierarchically as follows.
  Global:
     Inventory:
        Network
        Storage
     TechSupport
When the DataExportPolicy for a category is enabled/disabled, all the sub-category configurations
are enabled/disabled as well. For example, if you enable/disable Inventory, all its sub-category
configurations (ie. Network and Storage) are also enabled/disabled.
## Usage Example
### Resource Creation

```hcl
resource "intersight_appliance_data_export_policy" "appliance_data_export_policy1" {
  enable = true
  account {
    object_type = "iam.Account"
    moid        = var.account
  }
}

variable "account" {
  type        = string
  description = "Moid of iam.Account Mo"
}
```

## Argument Reference
The following arguments are supported:
* `account`:(HashMap) - A reference to a iamAccount resource.When the $expand query parameter is specified, the referenced resource is returned inline. 
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `moid`:(string) The Moid of the referenced REST resource. 
  + `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the remote type referred by this relationship. 
  + `selector`:(string) An OData $filter expression which describes the REST resource to be referenced. This field maybe set instead of 'moid' by clients.1. If 'moid' is set this field is ignored.1. If 'selector' is set and 'moid' is empty/absent from the request, Intersight determines the Moid of theresource matching the filter expression and populates it in the MoRef that is part of the objectinstance being inserted/updated to fulfill the REST request.An error is returned if the filter matches zero or more than one REST resource.An example filter string is: Serial eq '3AA8B7T11'. 
* `account_moid`:(string)(ReadOnly) The Account ID for this managed object. 
* `ancestors`:(Array)(ReadOnly) An array of relationships to moBaseMo resources.
