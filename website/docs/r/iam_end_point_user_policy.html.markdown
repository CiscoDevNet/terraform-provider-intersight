# Resource: intersight_iam._end_point_user_policy
Enables creation of local users on endpoints.
## Argument Reference
The following arguments are supported:
* `additional_properties`:
(Array with Maximum of one item) - Add additional properties in json format inside `jsonencode()` for this object.
* `class_id`:(string)(Computed) The concrete type of this complex type. Its value must be the same as the 'objectType' property.The OpenAPI document references this property as a discriminator value. 
* `description`:(string) Description of the policy. 
* `end_point_user_roles`:(Array) An array of relationships to iamEndPointUserRole resources. 
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `additional_properties`:
(Array with Maximum of one item) - Add additional properties in json format inside `jsonencode()` for this object.
  + `class_id`:(string)(Computed) The concrete type of this complex type. Its value must be the same as the 'objectType' property.The OpenAPI document references this property as a discriminator value. 
  + `moid`:(string)(Computed) The Moid of the referenced REST resource. 
  + `object_type`:(string) The concrete type of this complex type.The ObjectType property must be set explicitly by API clients when the type is ambiguous. In all other cases, the ObjectType is optional. The type is ambiguous when a managed object contains an array of nested documents, and the documents in the arrayare heterogeneous, i.e. the array can contain nested documents of different types. 
  + `selector`:(string)(Computed) An OData $filter expression which describes the REST resource to be referenced. This field maybe set instead of 'moid' by clients.1. If 'moid' is set this field is ignored.1. If 'selector' is set and 'moid' is empty/absent from the request, Intersight determines the Moid of theresource matching the filter expression and populates it in the MoRef that is part of the objectinstance being inserted/updated to fulfill the REST request.An error is returned if the filter matches zero or more than one REST resource.An example filter string is: Serial eq '3AA8B7T11'. 
* `moid`:(string) The unique identifier of this Managed Object instance. 
* `name`:(string) Name of the concrete policy. 
* `object_type`:(string)(Computed) The fully-qualified type of this managed object, i.e. the class name.This property is optional. The ObjectType is implied from the URL path.If specified, the value of objectType must match the class name specified in the URL path. 
* `organization`:(Array with Maximum of one item) - A reference to a organizationOrganization resource.When the $expand query parameter is specified, the referenced resource is returned inline.

* `password_properties`:(Array with Maximum of one item) - Set password properties for endpoint users. 
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `additional_properties`:
(Array with Maximum of one item) - Add additional properties in json format inside `jsonencode()` for this object.
  + `class_id`:(string)(Computed) The concrete type of this complex type. Its value must be the same as the 'objectType' property.The OpenAPI document references this property as a discriminator value. 
  + `enable_password_expiry`:(bool) Enables password expiry on the endpoint. 
  + `enforce_strong_password`:(bool) Enables a strong password policy Strong password requirements: A. The password must have a minimum of 8 and a maximum of 20 characters. B. The password must not contain the User's Name. C. The password must contain characters from three of the following four categories. 1) English uppercase characters (A through Z). 2) English lowercase characters (a through z). 3) Base 10 digits (0 through 9). 4) Non-alphabetic characters (! , @, #, $, %, ^, &, *, -, _, +, =). 
  + `force_send_password`:(bool) User password will always be sent to endpoint device. If the option is not selected, then users password will be sent to endpoint device if password is changed for existing users and for new users. 
  + `grace_period`:(int) Time period until when you can use the existing password, after it expires. 
  + `notification_period`:(int) The duration after which the password will expire. 
  + `object_type`:(string) The concrete type of this complex type.The ObjectType property must be set explicitly by API clients when the type is ambiguous. In all other cases, the ObjectType is optional. The type is ambiguous when a managed object contains an array of nested documents, and the documents in the arrayare heterogeneous, i.e. the array can contain nested documents of different types. 
  + `password_expiry_duration`:(int) Set time period for password expiration. Value should be greater than notification period and grace period. 
  + `password_history`:(int) Tracks password change history. Specifies in number of instances, that the new password was already used. 
* `profiles`:(Array) An array of relationships to policyAbstractConfigProfile resources.
