# Resource: intersight_iam_user_group
User Group provides a way to assign permissions to a group of users based on the IdP attributes received after authentication.
## Usage Example
### Resource Creation

```hcl
resource "intersight_iam_user_group" "iam_user_group1" {
  name = "iam_user_group1"
  idp {
    moid = var.idp_moid
    object_type = "iam.Idp"
  }
  permissions {
    moid        = var.iam_permission
    object_type = "iam.Permission"
    class_id    = "iam.Permission"
  }
}

variable "iam_permission" {
  type        = string
  description = "value for iam_permission"
}

variable "idp_moid" {
  type        = string
  description = "value for idp"
}
```

## Argument Reference
The following arguments are supported:
* `access_activation_time`:(string) AccessActivationTime indicates the activation time for the guest user's access to the Account.  Before this time, if guest user tries to login to the account, access the account will be denied. 
* `access_expiry_time`:(string) AccessExpiryTime indicates the expiration time for the guest user's access to the Account. Its value can only be  assigned a date that falls within the range determined by the maximum expiration time configured for the  API entries. The AccessExpiry date can be edited to be earlier or later. 
* `access_link`:(string)(ReadOnly) AccessLink using which the guest user uses to log in to Intersight. 
* `account_moid`:(string)(ReadOnly) The Account ID for this managed object. 
* `ancestors`:(Array)(ReadOnly) An array of relationships to moBaseMo resources. 
This complex property has following sub-properties:

  + `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the remote type referred by this relationship. 
  + `selector`:(string) An OData $filter expression which describes the REST resource to be referenced. This field maybe set instead of 'moid' by clients.1. If 'moid' is set this field is ignored.1. If 'selector' is set and 'moid' is empty/absent from the request, Intersight determines the Moid of theresource matching the filter expression and populates it in the MoRef that is part of the objectinstance being inserted/updated to fulfill the REST request.An error is returned if the filter matches zero or more than one REST resource.An example filter string is: Serial eq '3AA8B7T11'.
