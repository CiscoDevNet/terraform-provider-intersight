# Resource: intersight_fabric_switch_cluster_profile
This specifies the configuration policies for a cluster of switches.
## Usage Example
### Resource Creation

```hcl
resource "intersight_fabric_switch_cluster_profile" "fabric_switch_cluster_profile1" {
  name        = "fabric_switch_cluster_profile"
  description = "demo fabric switch cluster profile"
  type        = "instance"
  organization {
    object_type = "organization.Organization"
    moid        = var.organization_organization
  }
}
```
## Argument Reference
The following arguments are supported:
* `account_moid`:(string)(Computed) The Account ID for this managed object. 
* `ancestors`:(Array)(Computed) An array of relationships to moBaseMo resources. 
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `moid`:(string) The Moid of the referenced REST resource. 
  + `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the remote type referred by this relationship. 
  + `selector`:(string) An OData $filter expression which describes the REST resource to be referenced. This field maybe set instead of 'moid' by clients.1. If 'moid' is set this field is ignored.1. If 'selector' is set and 'moid' is empty/absent from the request, Intersight determines the Moid of theresource matching the filter expression and populates it in the MoRef that is part of the objectinstance being inserted/updated to fulfill the REST request.An error is returned if the filter matches zero or more than one REST resource.An example filter string is: Serial eq '3AA8B7T11'. 
* `config_context`:(HashMap) -(Computed) This provides consolidated configuration context of all the switch profiles referred by Switch Cluster Profile. 
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `config_state`:(string)(Computed) Indicates a profile's configuration deploying state. Values -- Assigned, Not-assigned, Associated, Pending-changes, Out-of-sync, Validating, Configuring, Failed. 
  + `control_action`:(string) System action to trigger the appropriate workflow. Values -- No_op, ConfigChange, Deploy, Unbind. 
  + `error_state`:(string) Indicates a profile's error state. Values -- Validation-error (Static validation error), Pre-config-error (Runtime validation error), Config-error (Runtime configuration error). 
  + `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type.The value should be the same as the 'ClassId' property. 
  + `oper_state`:(string)(Computed) Combined state (configState, and operational state of the associated physical resource) to indicate the current state of the profile. Values -- n/a, Power-off, Pending-changes, Configuring, Ok, Failed. 
* `create_time`:(string)(Computed) The time when this managed object was created. 
* `description`:(string) Description of the profile.
