# Resource: intersight_server_profile_template
A profile template specifying configuration settings for a physical server.
## Usage Example
### Resource Creation

```hcl
resource "intersight_server_profile_template" "template1" {
  name            = "server_profile_template1"
  description     = "demo server profile template"
  target_platform = "FIAttached"
   organization {
     object_type = "organization.Organization"
     moid        = var.organization
   }
  # the following policy_bucket statements map different policies to this
  # template -- the object_type shows the policy type
   policy_bucket {

## Argument Reference
The following arguments are supported:
* `account_moid`:(string)(ReadOnly) The Account ID for this managed object. 
* `action`:(string) User initiated action. Each profile type has its own supported actions. For HyperFlex cluster profile, the supported actions are -- Validate, Deploy, Continue, Retry, Abort, Unassign For server profile, the support actions are -- Deploy, Unassign. 
* `action_params`:(Array)
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `name`:(string) The action parameter identifier. 
  + `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type.The value should be the same as the 'ClassId' property.

If 'selector' is set and 'moid' is empty/absent from the request, Intersight determines the Moid of theresource matching the filter expression and populates it in the MoRef that is part of the objectinstance being inserted/updated to fulfill the REST request.An error is returned if the filter matches zero or more than one REST resource.An example filter string is: Serial eq '3AA8B7T11'.
