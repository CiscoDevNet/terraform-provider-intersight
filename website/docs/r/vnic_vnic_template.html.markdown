        The vNIC template consists of the common vNIC configuration, which can be reused across multiple vNICs. vNICs can be created from the template using the Derive operation. Additionally, an existing vNIC can be attached to a template to use the configuration set in the template.
        To derive vNICs from a vNIC template, you must use the asynchronous /v1/bulk/MoCloners bulk API.

        The API response includes the AsyncResult->bulk.Result MO reference. API clients must poll the bulk.Result MO to monitor the status of the operation.
        The bulk.Result object also includes a reference to a monitoring workflow, which is accessible from the 'Requests' tab in the UI.
        Managing Template Updates
        When the vNIC template is updated, the system initiates an automatic call to the /v1/bulk/MoMergers API to synchronize the template changes to all derived vNIC instances asynchronously. The status of the sync operation can be obtained by performing a query on vnic EthIf MO -
        $filter=SrcTemplate.Moid eq 'xxx'&$apply=groupby ( (TemplateSyncStatus), aggregate ($count as count))
        Override Option for vNIC Templates
        When enabled, this feature allows the configuration of the derived vNIC to override the configuration available in the template during vNIC create or update.
        You can query the list of overridable properties for a vNIC template from the Template Catalog. Use the following catalog API query:
        URL: /v1/capability/TemplateCatalogs
        Query: $filter= (Name eq ‘VnicTemplate’)&$select=AllowedOverrideList
        Once a property is overridden on a derived vNIC, it will be added to the ‘OverriddenList’ property on the vnic EthIf MO:
        URL: /v1/vnic/EthIfs
        Query: $select=SrcTemplate, OverriddenList
        When override is disabled on the template, derived vNIC will have same configuration as the template.

Managing Template Updates
When the vNIC template is updated, the system initiates an automatic call to the /v1/bulk/MoMergers API to synchronize the template changes to all derived vNIC instances asynchronously. The status of the sync operation can be obtained by performing a query on vnic EthIf MO -
$filter=SrcTemplate.Moid eq 'xxx'&$apply=groupby ( (TemplateSyncStatus), aggregate ($count as count))
Override Option for vNIC Templates
When enabled, this feature allows the configuration of the derived vNIC to override the configuration available in the template during vNIC create or update.
You can query the list of overridable properties for a vNIC template from the Template Catalog. Use the following catalog API query:
URL: /v1/capability/TemplateCatalogs
Query: $filter= (Name eq ‘VnicTemplate’)&$select=AllowedOverrideList
Once a property is overridden on a derived vNIC, it will be added to the ‘OverriddenList’ property on the vnic EthIf MO:
URL: /v1/vnic/EthIfs
Query: $select=SrcTemplate, OverriddenList
When override is disabled on the template, derived vNIC will have same configuration as the template.
