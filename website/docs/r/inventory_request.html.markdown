        Request MO allows the inventory of specific devices to be collected on demand. The inventory can be collected in three levels - all the MOs of a specific device, MOs of specific MO types for a given device or specific MO instances of specific MO types for a given device. These MO instances are used just to collect the requests and not persisted.

# Resource: intersight_inventory_request
Request MO allows the inventory of specific devices to be collected on demand. The inventory can be collected in three levels - all the MOs of a specific device, MOs of specific MO types for a given device or specific MO instances of specific MO types for a given device. These MO instances are used just to collect the requests and not persisted.
## Argument Reference
The following arguments are supported:
* `account_moid`:(string)(ReadOnly) The Account ID for this managed object. 
* `ancestors`:(Array)(ReadOnly) An array of relationships to moBaseMo resources. 
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `moid`:(string) The Moid of the referenced REST resource. 
  + `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the remote type referred by this relationship. 
  + `selector`:(string) An OData $filter expression which describes the REST resource to be referenced. This field maybe set instead of 'moid' by clients.1. If 'moid' is set this field is ignored.1. If 'selector' is set and 'moid' is empty/absent from the request, Intersight determines the Moid of theresource matching the filter expression and populates it in the MoRef that is part of the objectinstance being inserted/updated to fulfill the REST request.An error is returned if the filter matches zero or more than one REST resource.An example filter string is: Serial eq '3AA8B7T11'. 
* `create_time`:(string)(ReadOnly) The time when this managed object was created. 
* `device`:(HashMap) - A reference to a assetDeviceRegistration resource.When the $expand query parameter is specified, the referenced resource is returned inline.

* `domain_group_moid`:(string)(ReadOnly) The DomainGroup ID for this managed object. 
* `mod_time`:(string)(ReadOnly) The time when this managed object was last modified. 
* `moid`:(string) The unique identifier of this Managed Object instance. 
* `mos`:(Array)
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `mo_dn`:(string) The UCS DN of the MO for which the latest inventory to be fetched. If this property is empty and moId property has the Moid of the MO to be updated, the Moid will be used. If this property is empty and moId is also empty, all the MOs of the given moType will be updated. 
  + `mo_id`:(string) The MO id of an MO for which the latest inventory to be fetched. If this property is empty and moDn property has the UCS DN of the MO to be updated, the DN will be used. If this property is empty and moDn is also empty, all the MOs of the given moType will be updated. 
  + `mo_type`:(string) The type of the MO for which the latest inventory to be fetched. 
  + `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type.The value should be the same as the 'ClassId' property. 
* `owners`:
                (Array of schema.TypeString) -(ReadOnly)
* `parent`:(HashMap) -(ReadOnly) A reference to a moBaseMo resource.When the $expand query parameter is specified, the referenced resource is returned inline. 
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `moid`:(string) The Moid of the referenced REST resource. 
  + `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the remote type referred by this relationship. 
  + `selector`:(string) An OData $filter expression which describes the REST resource to be referenced. This field maybe set instead of 'moid' by clients.1. If 'moid' is set this field is ignored.1. If 'selector' is set and 'moid' is empty/absent from the request, Intersight determines the Moid of theresource matching the filter expression and populates it in the MoRef that is part of the objectinstance being inserted/updated to fulfill the REST request.An error is returned if the filter matches zero or more than one REST resource.An example filter string is: Serial eq '3AA8B7T11'. 
* `permission_resources`:(Array)(ReadOnly) An array of relationships to moBaseMo resources. 
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `moid`:(string) The Moid of the referenced REST resource. 
  + `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the remote type referred by this relationship. 
  + `selector`:(string) An OData $filter expression which describes the REST resource to be referenced. This field maybe set instead of 'moid' by clients.1. If 'moid' is set this field is ignored.1. If 'selector' is set and 'moid' is empty/absent from the request, Intersight determines the Moid of theresource matching the filter expression and populates it in the MoRef that is part of the objectinstance being inserted/updated to fulfill the REST request.An error is returned if the filter matches zero or more than one REST resource.An example filter string is: Serial eq '3AA8B7T11'. 
* `shared_scope`:(string)(ReadOnly) Intersight provides pre-built workflows, tasks and policies to end users through global catalogs.Objects that are made available through global catalogs are said to have a 'shared' ownership. Shared objects are either made globally available to all end users or restricted to end users based on their license entitlement.

  + `version_type`:(string)(ReadOnly) Specifies type of version. Currently the only supported value is \ Configured\ that is used to keep track of snapshots of policies and profiles that are intendedto be configured to target endpoints.* `Modified` - Version created every time an object is modified.* `Configured` - Version created every time an object is configured to the service profile.* `Deployed` - Version created for objects related to a service profile when it is deployed.
