# Resource: intersight_server_profile
A profile specifying configuration settings for a physical server.
## Usage Example
### Resource Creation

```hcl
resource "intersight_server_profile" "server1" {
  name   = "server1"
  action = "No-op"
  tags {
    key   = "server"
    value = "demo"
  }
  organization {
    object_type = "organization.Organization"
    moid        = var.organization

  + `moid`:(string) The Moid of the referenced REST resource. 
  + `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the remote type referred by this relationship. 
  + `selector`:(string) An OData $filter expression which describes the REST resource to be referenced. This field maybe set instead of 'moid' by clients.1. If 'moid' is set this field is ignored.1. If 'selector' is set and 'moid' is empty/absent from the request, Intersight determines the Moid of theresource matching the filter expression and populates it in the MoRef that is part of the objectinstance being inserted/updated to fulfill the REST request.An error is returned if the filter matches zero or more than one REST resource.An example filter string is: Serial eq '3AA8B7T11'. 
* `version_context`:(HashMap) -(ReadOnly) The versioning info for this managed object.

Currently the only supported value is \ Configured\ that is used to keep track of snapshots of policies and profiles that are intendedto be configured to target endpoints.* `Modified` - Version created every time an object is modified.* `Configured` - Version created every time an object is configured to the service profile.* `Deployed` - Version created for objects related to a service profile when it is deployed. 

### Custom keywords
These are
* `wait_for_completion`:(bool) This model object can trigger workflows. Use this option to wait for all running workflows to reach a complete state. Default value is True i.e. wait.
