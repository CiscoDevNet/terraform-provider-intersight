# Resource: intersight_iam._trust_point
To affirm the identity of trusted source.
Allows import of third-party CA certificates in X.509 (CER) format.
It can be a root CA or an trust chain that leads to a root CA.
## Argument Reference
The following arguments are supported:
* `account`:(Array with Maximum of one item) -(Computed) A reference to a iamAccount resource.When the $expand query parameter is specified, the referenced resource is returned inline. 
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `additional_properties`:
(Array with Maximum of one item) - Add additional properties in json format inside `jsonencode()` for this object.
  + `class_id`:(string)(Computed) The concrete type of this complex type. Its value must be the same as the 'objectType' property.The OpenAPI document references this property as a discriminator value. 
  + `moid`:(string)(Computed) The Moid of the referenced REST resource. 
  + `object_type`:(string) The concrete type of this complex type.The ObjectType property must be set explicitly by API clients when the type is ambiguous. In all other cases, the ObjectType is optional. The type is ambiguous when a managed object contains an array of nested documents, and the documents in the arrayare heterogeneous, i.e. the array can contain nested documents of different types. 
  + `selector`:(string)(Computed) An OData $filter expression which describes the REST resource to be referenced. This field maybe set instead of 'moid' by clients.1. If 'moid' is set this field is ignored.1. If 'selector' is set and 'moid' is empty/absent from the request, Intersight determines the Moid of theresource matching the filter expression and populates it in the MoRef that is part of the objectinstance being inserted/updated to fulfill the REST request.An error is returned if the filter matches zero or more than one REST resource.An example filter string is: Serial eq '3AA8B7T11'. 
* `additional_properties`:
(Array with Maximum of one item) - Add additional properties in json format inside `jsonencode()` for this object.
* `certificates`:(Array)
This complex property has following sub-properties:

  + `class_id`:(string)(Computed) The concrete type of this complex type. Its value must be the same as the 'objectType' property.The OpenAPI document references this property as a discriminator value. 
  + `issuer`:(Array with Maximum of one item) -(Computed) The X.509 distinguished name of the issuer of this certificate.

    + `state`:
                (Array of schema.TypeString) -
  + `object_type`:(string) The concrete type of this complex type.The ObjectType property must be set explicitly by API clients when the type is ambiguous. In all other cases, the ObjectType is optional. The type is ambiguous when a managed object contains an array of nested documents, and the documents in the arrayare heterogeneous, i.e. the array can contain nested documents of different types. 
  + `pem_certificate`:(string) The base64 encoded certificate in PEM format. 
  + `sha256_fingerprint`:(string)(Computed) The computed SHA-256 fingerprint of the certificate. Equivalent to 'openssl x509 -fingerprint -sha256'. 
  + `signature_algorithm`:(string)(Computed) Signature algorithm, as specified in [RFC 5280](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5280). 
  + `subject`:(Array with Maximum of one item) -(Computed) The X.509 distinguished name of the subject of this certificate.
