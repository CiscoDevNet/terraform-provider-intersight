# Resource: intersight_capability_switch_capability
Type to represent additional switch specific capabilities.
## Usage Example
### Resource Creation

```hcl
resource "intersight_capability_switch_capability" "capability_switch_capability1" {
  name                     = "capability_switch_capability1"
  pid                      = "UCS-FI-6454"
  sku                      = "CON-NCF4P-FI6454CH"
  vid                      = "V00"
  dynamic_vifs_supported   = true
  fan_modules_supported    = true

## Argument Reference
The following arguments are supported:
* `account_moid`:(string)(ReadOnly) The Account ID for this managed object. 
* `ancestors`:(Array)(ReadOnly) An array of relationships to moBaseMo resources. 
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `moid`:(string) The Moid of the referenced REST resource. 
  + `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the remote type referred by this relationship.
