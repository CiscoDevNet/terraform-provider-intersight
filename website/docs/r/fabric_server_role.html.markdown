# Resource: intersight_fabric_server_role
Configuration object sent by user to create a server port.
## Usage Example
### Resource Creation

```hcl
resource "intersight_fabric_server_role" "fabric_server_role1" {
  aggregate_port_id = 0
  port_id           = 16
  slot_id           = 1
  port_policy {
    moid        = intersight_fabric_port_policy.fabric_port_policy1.moid
    object_type = "fabric.PortPolicy"
  }
}
```
## Argument Reference
The following arguments are supported:
* `account_moid`:(string)(ReadOnly) The Account ID for this managed object. 
* `aggregate_port_id`:(int) Breakout port Identifier of the Switch Interface.When a port is not configured as a breakout port, the aggregatePortId is set to 0, and unused.When a port is configured as a breakout port, the 'aggregatePortId' port number as labeled on the equipment,e.g. the id of the port on the switch. 
* `ancestors`:(Array)(ReadOnly) An array of relationships to moBaseMo resources. 
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `moid`:(string) The Moid of the referenced REST resource. 
  + `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the remote type referred by this relationship. 
  + `selector`:(string) An OData $filter expression which describes the REST resource to be referenced. This field maybe set instead of 'moid' by clients.1. If 'moid' is set this field is ignored.1. If 'selector' is set and 'moid' is empty/absent from the request, Intersight determines the Moid of theresource matching the filter expression and populates it in the MoRef that is part of the objectinstance being inserted/updated to fulfill the REST request.An error is returned if the filter matches zero or more than one REST resource.An example filter string is: Serial eq '3AA8B7T11'. 
* `auto_negotiation_disabled`:(bool) Auto negotiation configuration for server port. This configuration is required only for FEX Model N9K-C93180YC-FX3 connected with 100G speed port on UCS-FI-6536 and should be set as True. 
* `create_time`:(string)(ReadOnly) The time when this managed object was created. 
* `domain_group_moid`:(string)(ReadOnly) The DomainGroup ID for this managed object. 
* `fec`:(string) Forward error correction configuration for server port. This configuration is required only for FEX Model N9K-C93180YC-FX3 connected with 25G speed ports on UCS-FI-6454/UCS-FI-64108 and should be set as Cl74.* `Auto` - Forward error correction option 'Auto'.* `Cl91` - Forward error correction option 'cl91'.* `Cl74` - Forward error correction option 'cl74'. 
* `mod_time`:(string)(ReadOnly) The time when this managed object was last modified. 
* `moid`:(string) The unique identifier of this Managed Object instance. 
* `owners`:
                (Array of schema.TypeString) -(ReadOnly)
* `parent`:(HashMap) -(ReadOnly) A reference to a moBaseMo resource.When the $expand query parameter is specified, the referenced resource is returned inline.

* `port_id`:(int) Port Identifier of the Switch/FEX/Chassis Interface.When a port is not configured as a breakout port, the portId is the port number as labeled on the equipment,e.g. the id of the port on the switch, FEX or chassis.When a port is configured as a breakout port, the 'portId' represents the port id on the fanout side of the breakout cable. 
* `port_policy`:(HashMap) - A reference to a fabricPortPolicy resource.When the $expand query parameter is specified, the referenced resource is returned inline. 
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `moid`:(string) The Moid of the referenced REST resource. 
  + `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the remote type referred by this relationship. 
  + `selector`:(string) An OData $filter expression which describes the REST resource to be referenced. This field maybe set instead of 'moid' by clients.1. If 'moid' is set this field is ignored.1.

* `preferred_device_id`:(int) Preferred device ID to be configured by user for the connected device. This ID must be specified together with the 'PreferredDeviceType' property. This ID will only takes effect if the actual connected device matches the 'PreferredDeviceType'. If the preferred ID is not available, the ID is automatically allocated and assigned by the system. If different preferred IDs are specified for the ports connected to the same device, only the preferred ID (if specified) of the port that is discovered first will be considered. 
* `preferred_device_type`:(string) Device type for which preferred ID to be configured. If the actual connected device does not match the specified device type, the system ignores the 'PreferredDeviceId' property.* `Auto` - Preferred Id will be ignored if specified with this type.* `RackServer` - Connected device type is Rack Unit Server.* `Chassis` - Connected device type is Chassis. 
* `shared_scope`:(string)(ReadOnly) Intersight provides pre-built workflows, tasks and policies to end users through global catalogs.Objects that are made available through global catalogs are said to have a 'shared' ownership. Shared objects are either made globally available to all end users or restricted to end users based on their license entitlement. Users can use this property to differentiate the scope (global or a specific license tier) to which a shared MO belongs.
