# Resource: intersight_workflow_service_item_action_instance
Service item action instance which represents one action on a service item instance.
## Argument Reference
The following arguments are supported:
* `account_moid`:(string)(ReadOnly) The Account ID for this managed object. 
* `action`:(string) Name of the action that needs to be performed on the service item instance.* `None` - No action is set, this is the default value for action field.* `Validate` - Validate the action instance inputs and run the validation workflows.* `Start` - Start a new execution of the action instance.* `Rerun` - Rerun the service item action instance from the beginning.* `Retry` - Retry the workflow that has failed from the failure point.* `Cancel` - Cancel the core workflow that is in running or waiting state. This action can be used when the workflows are stuck and not progressing.* `Stop` - Stop the action instance which is in progress and didn't complete successfully. Use this action to clear the state and then delete the action instance. A completed action cannot be stopped. 
* `action_workflow_info`:(HashMap) -(ReadOnly) A reference to a workflowWorkflowInfo resource.When the $expand query parameter is specified, the referenced resource is returned inline.
