# Resource: intersight_resource_group
A group of REST resources, such as a group of compute.Blade MOs. A ResourceGroup can contain static members which are specified as a set of object references, or it can contain dynamic members, which are specified through OData query filters. A Resource can be part of multiple resource groups.
## Usage Example
### Resource Creation

```hcl
resource "intersight_resource_group" "resource_group1" {
  name = "resource_group1"
  per_type_combined_selector {
    class_id    = "resource.PerTypeCombinedSelector"
    object_type = "resource.PerTypeCombinedSelector"
  }
  qualifier = "Allow-Selectors"
  selectors {
    object_type = "resource.Selector"
    class_id    = "resource.Selector"
    selector    = "/api/v1/asset/DeviceRegistrations?$filter=Moid in(\"intersight_asset_device_registrations_registeration1.id\")"
  }
  account {
    object_type = "iam.Account"
    moid        = var.account
  }
  organizations {
    object_type = "organization.Organization"
    moid        = var.organization
  }
}

variable "account" {
  type        = string
  description = "Moid of iam.Account"
}

variable "organization" {
  type        = string
  description = "value for organization"
}
```
## Argument Reference
The following arguments are supported:
* `account`:(HashMap) -(ReadOnly) A reference to a iamAccount resource.When the $expand query parameter is specified, the referenced resource is returned inline. 
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `moid`:(string) The Moid of the referenced REST resource. 
  + `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the remote type referred by this relationship. 
  + `selector`:(string) An OData $filter expression which describes the REST resource to be referenced. This field maybe set instead of 'moid' by clients.1. If 'moid' is set this field is ignored.1. If 'selector' is set and 'moid' is empty/absent from the request, Intersight determines the Moid of theresource matching the filter expression and populates it in the MoRef that is part of the objectinstance being inserted/updated to fulfill the REST request.An error is returned if the filter matches zero or more than one REST resource.An example filter string is: Serial eq '3AA8B7T11'. 
* `account_moid`:(string)(ReadOnly) The Account ID for this managed object. 
* `ancestors`:(Array)(ReadOnly) An array of relationships to moBaseMo resources.
