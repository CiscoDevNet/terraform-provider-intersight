# Resource: intersight_fabric_system_qos_policy
Configuration object sent by user to setup Quality of Service (QoS) for this switch.
## Usage Example
### Resource Creation

```hcl
resource "intersight_fabric_system_qos_policy" "fabric_system_qos_policy1" {
  name        = "fabric_system_qos_policy1"
  description = "demo fabric system qos policy"
  classes {
    admin_state        = "Enabled"
    bandwidth_percent  = 80
    cos                = 255
    mtu                = 2240
    multicast_optimize = true
    name               = "Best Effort"
    packet_drop        = true
    class_id           = "fabric.QosClass"
    object_type        = "fabric.QosClass"
    weight             = 5
  }

## Argument Reference
The following arguments are supported:
* `account_moid`:(string)(ReadOnly) The Account ID for this managed object. 
* `ancestors`:(Array)(ReadOnly) An array of relationships to moBaseMo resources. 
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `moid`:(string) The Moid of the referenced REST resource. 
  + `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the remote type referred by this relationship. 
  + `selector`:(string) An OData $filter expression which describes the REST resource to be referenced. This field maybe set instead of 'moid' by clients.1. If 'moid' is set this field is ignored.1. If 'selector' is set and 'moid' is empty/absent from the request, Intersight determines the Moid of theresource matching the filter expression and populates it in the MoRef that is part of the objectinstance being inserted/updated to fulfill the REST request.An error is returned if the filter matches zero or more than one REST resource.An example filter string is: Serial eq '3AA8B7T11'. 
* `classes`:(Array)
This complex property has following sub-properties:
