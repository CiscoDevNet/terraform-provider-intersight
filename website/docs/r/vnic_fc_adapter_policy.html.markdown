# Resource: intersight_vnic_fc_adapter_policy
A Fibre Channel Adapter policy governs the host-side behavior of the adapter, including how the adapter handles traffic. You can enable FCP Error Recovery, change the default settings of Queues and Interrupt handling for performance enhancement.
## Usage Example
### Resource Creation

```hcl
resource "intersight_vnic_fc_adapter_policy" "v_fc_adapter1" {
  name                    = "v_fc_adapter1"
  error_detection_timeout = 100000
  organization {
    object_type = "organization.Organization"
    moid        = var.organization
  }
  error_recovery_settings {
    enabled           = false
    io_retry_count    = 255
    io_retry_timeout  = 50
    link_down_timeout = 240000
    port_down_timeout = 240000
    object_type       = "vnic.FcErrorRecoverySettings"
  }

  flogi_settings {
    retries     = 0
    timeout     = 255000
    object_type = "vnic.FlogiSettings"
  }

  interrupt_settings {
    mode        = "MSIx"
    object_type = "vnic.FcInterruptSettings"
  }

  io_throttle_count = 1024
  lun_count         = 1024
  lun_queue_depth   = 254

  plogi_settings {
    retries     = 255
    timeout     = 255000
    object_type = "vnic.PlogiSettings"
  }
  resource_allocation_timeout = 100000

  rx_queue_settings {
    ring_size   = 128
    object_type = "vnic.FcQueueSettings"
  }
  tx_queue_settings {
    ring_size   = 128
    object_type = "vnic.FcQueueSettings"
  }


  scsi_queue_settings {
    nr_count    = 8
    ring_size   = 152
    object_type = "vnic.ScsiQueueSettings"
  }

}

variable "organization" {
  type        = string

## Argument Reference
The following arguments are supported:
* `account_moid`:(string)(ReadOnly) The Account ID for this managed object. 
* `ancestors`:(Array)(ReadOnly) An array of relationships to moBaseMo resources. 
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `moid`:(string) The Moid of the referenced REST resource. 
  + `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the remote type referred by this relationship. 
  + `selector`:(string) An OData $filter expression which describes the REST resource to be referenced. This field maybe set instead of 'moid' by clients.1. If 'moid' is set this field is ignored.1. If 'selector' is set and 'moid' is empty/absent from the request, Intersight determines the Moid of theresource matching the filter expression and populates it in the MoRef that is part of the objectinstance being inserted/updated to fulfill the REST request.An error is returned if the filter matches zero or more than one REST resource.An example filter string is: Serial eq '3AA8B7T11'. 
* `create_time`:(string)(ReadOnly) The time when this managed object was created. 
* `description`:(string) Description of the policy. 
* `domain_group_moid`:(string)(ReadOnly) The DomainGroup ID for this managed object. 
* `error_detection_timeout`:(int) Error Detection Timeout, also referred to as EDTOV, is the number of milliseconds to wait before the system assumes that an error has occurred. 
* `error_recovery_settings`:(HashMap) - Fibre Channel Error Recovery Settings. 
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `enabled`:(bool) Enables Fibre Channel Error recovery. 
  + `io_retry_count`:(int) The number of times an I/O request to a port is retried because the port is busy before the system decides the port is unavailable. 
  + `io_retry_timeout`:(int) The number of seconds the adapter waits before aborting the pending command and resending the same IO request. 
  + `link_down_timeout`:(int) The number of milliseconds the port should actually be down before it is marked down and fabric connectivity is lost. 
  + `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type.The value should be the same as the 'ClassId' property. 
  + `port_down_timeout`:(int) The number of milliseconds a remote Fibre Channel port should be offline before informing the SCSI upper layer that the port is unavailable. For a server with a VIC adapter running ESXi, the recommended value is 10000. For a server with a port used to boot a Windows OS from the SAN, the recommended value is 5000 milliseconds.
