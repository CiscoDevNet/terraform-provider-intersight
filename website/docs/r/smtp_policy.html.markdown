# Resource: intersight_smtp_policy
Name that identifies the SMTP Policy.
## Usage Example
### Resource Creation

```hcl
resource "intersight_smtp_policy" "smtp1" {
  enabled      = false
  name         = "smtp1"
  description  = "testing smtp policy"
  smtp_port    = 32
  min_severity = "critical"
  smtp_server  = "10.10.10.1"
  sender_email = "IMCSQAAutomation@cisco.com"
  smtp_recipients = [
    "aw@cisco.com",
    "cy@cisco.com",
  "dz@cisco.com"]
  organization {
    object_type = "organization.Organization"
    moid        = var.organization
  }
  profiles {
    moid        = intersight_server_profile.server1.id
    object_type = "server.Profile"
  }
}
```
## Argument Reference
The following arguments are supported:
* `account_moid`:(string)(Computed) The Account ID for this managed object. 
* `ancestors`:(Array)(Computed) An array of relationships to moBaseMo resources. 
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `moid`:(string) The Moid of the referenced REST resource. 
  + `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the remote type referred by this relationship. 
  + `selector`:(string) An OData $filter expression which describes the REST resource to be referenced. This field maybe set instead of 'moid' by clients.1. If 'moid' is set this field is ignored.1. If 'selector' is set and 'moid' is empty/absent from the request, Intersight determines the Moid of theresource matching the filter expression and populates it in the MoRef that is part of the objectinstance being inserted/updated to fulfill the REST request.An error is returned if the filter matches zero or more than one REST resource.An example filter string is: Serial eq '3AA8B7T11'. 
* `create_time`:(string)(Computed) The time when this managed object was created. 
* `description`:(string) Description of the policy. 
* `domain_group_moid`:(string)(Computed) The DomainGroup ID for this managed object. 
* `enabled`:(bool) If enabled, controls the state of the SMTP client service on the managed device. 
* `min_severity`:(string) Minimum fault severity level to receive email notifications. Email notifications are sent for all faults whose severity is equal to or greater than the chosen level.* `critical` - Minimum severity to report is critical.* `condition` - Minimum severity to report is informational.* `warning` - Minimum severity to report is warning.* `minor` - Minimum severity to report is minor.* `major` - Minimum severity to report is major. 
* `mod_time`:(string)(Computed) The time when this managed object was last modified. 
* `moid`:(string) The unique identifier of this Managed Object instance. 
* `name`:(string) Name of the concrete policy. 
* `organization`:(HashMap) - A reference to a organizationOrganization resource.When the $expand query parameter is specified, the referenced resource is returned inline.
