# Resource: intersight_iam._ldap_policy
LDAP Policy configurations.
## Argument Reference
The following arguments are supported:
* `additional_properties`:
(Array with Maximum of one item) - Add additional properties in json format inside `jsonencode()` for this object.
* `appliance_account`:(Array with Maximum of one item) - A reference to a iamAccount resource.When the $expand query parameter is specified, the referenced resource is returned inline. 
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `additional_properties`:
(Array with Maximum of one item) - Add additional properties in json format inside `jsonencode()` for this object.
  + `class_id`:(string)(Computed) The concrete type of this complex type. Its value must be the same as the 'objectType' property.The OpenAPI document references this property as a discriminator value. 
  + `moid`:(string)(Computed) The Moid of the referenced REST resource. 
  + `object_type`:(string) The concrete type of this complex type.The ObjectType property must be set explicitly by API clients when the type is ambiguous. In all other cases, the ObjectType is optional. The type is ambiguous when a managed object contains an array of nested documents, and the documents in the arrayare heterogeneous, i.e. the array can contain nested documents of different types. 
  + `selector`:(string)(Computed) An OData $filter expression which describes the REST resource to be referenced. This field maybe set instead of 'moid' by clients.1. If 'moid' is set this field is ignored.1. If 'selector' is set and 'moid' is empty/absent from the request, Intersight determines the Moid of theresource matching the filter expression and populates it in the MoRef that is part of the objectinstance being inserted/updated to fulfill the REST request.An error is returned if the filter matches zero or more than one REST resource.An example filter string is: Serial eq '3AA8B7T11'. 
* `base_properties`:(Array with Maximum of one item) - Base settings of LDAP required while configuring LDAP policy. 
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `additional_properties`:
(Array with Maximum of one item) - Add additional properties in json format inside `jsonencode()` for this object.
  + `attribute`:(string) Role and locale information of the user. 
  + `base_dn`:(string) Base Distinguished Name (DN). Starting point from where server will search for users and groups. 
  + `bind_dn`:(string) Distinguished Name (DN) of the user, that is used to authenticate against LDAP servers. 
  + `bind_method`:(string) Authentication method to access LDAP servers.* `LoginCredentials` - Requires the user credentials. If the bind process fails, then user is denied access.* `Anonymous` - Requires no username and password. If this option is selected and the LDAP server is configured for Anonymous logins, then the user gains access.* `ConfiguredCredentials` - Requires a known set of credentials to be specified for the initial bind process. If the initial bind process succeeds, then the distinguished name (DN) of the user name is queried and re-used for the re-binding process. If the re-binding process fails, then the user is denied access. 
  + `class_id`:(string)(Computed) The concrete type of this complex type. Its value must be the same as the 'objectType' property.The OpenAPI document references this property as a discriminator value. 
  + `domain`:(string) The IPv4 domain that all users must be in. 
  + `enable_encryption`:(bool) If enabled, the endpoint encrypts all information it sends to the LDAP server.

  + `filter`:(string) Criteria to identify entries in search requests. 
  + `group_attribute`:(string) Groups to which an LDAP entry belongs. 
  + `is_password_set`:(bool)(Computed) Indicates whether the value of the 'password' property has been set. 
  + `nested_group_search_depth`:(int) Search depth to look for a nested LDAP group in an LDAP group map. 
  + `object_type`:(string) The concrete type of this complex type.The ObjectType property must be set explicitly by API clients when the type is ambiguous. In all other cases, the ObjectType is optional. The type is ambiguous when a managed object contains an array of nested documents, and the documents in the arrayare heterogeneous, i.e. the array can contain nested documents of different types. 
  + `password`:(string) Password of the user, that is used to authenticate. 
  + `timeout`:(int) LDAP authentication timeout duration, in seconds. 
* `class_id`:(string)(Computed) The concrete type of this complex type. Its value must be the same as the 'objectType' property.The OpenAPI document references this property as a discriminator value. 
* `description`:(string) Description of the policy. 
* `dns_parameters`:(Array with Maximum of one item) - Configuration settings to resolve LDAP servers, when DNS is enabled.
