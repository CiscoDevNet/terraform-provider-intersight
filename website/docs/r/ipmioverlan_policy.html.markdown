# Resource: intersight_ipmioverlan_policy
Intelligent Platform Management Interface Over LAN Policy.
## Usage Example
### Resource Creation

```hcl
resource "intersight_ipmioverlan_policy" "ipmi1" {
  name           = "ipmi1"
  description    = "demo ipmi policy"
  enabled        = true
  privilege      = "admin"
  encryption_key = var.encryption_key
  organization {
    object_type = "organization.Organization"
    moid        = var.organization
  }
}

variable "organization" {
  type = string
  description = "value for organization"
}

variable "encryption_key" {
  type = string
  description = "value for encryption key"
}
```
## Argument Reference
The following arguments are supported:
* `account_moid`:(string)(ReadOnly) The Account ID for this managed object. 
* `ancestors`:(Array)(ReadOnly) An array of relationships to moBaseMo resources. 
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `moid`:(string) The Moid of the referenced REST resource. 
  + `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the remote type referred by this relationship. 
  + `selector`:(string) An OData $filter expression which describes the REST resource to be referenced. This field maybe set instead of 'moid' by clients.1. If 'moid' is set this field is ignored.1. If 'selector' is set and 'moid' is empty/absent from the request, Intersight determines the Moid of theresource matching the filter expression and populates it in the MoRef that is part of the objectinstance being inserted/updated to fulfill the REST request.An error is returned if the filter matches zero or more than one REST resource.An example filter string is: Serial eq '3AA8B7T11'. 
* `create_time`:(string)(ReadOnly) The time when this managed object was created. 
* `description`:(string) Description of the policy. 
* `domain_group_moid`:(string)(ReadOnly) The DomainGroup ID for this managed object. 
* `enabled`:(bool) State of the IPMI Over LAN service on the endpoint. 
* `encryption_key`:(string) The encryption key to use for IPMI communication. It should have an even number of hexadecimal characters and not exceed 40 characters. Use “00” to disable encryption key use. This configuration is supported by all Standalone C-Series servers. FI-attached C-Series servers with firmware at minimum of 4.2.3a support this configuration. B/X-Series servers with firmware at minimum of 5.1.0.x support this configuration. IPMI commands using this key should append zeroes to the key to achieve a length of 40 characters. 
* `is_encryption_key_set`:(bool)(ReadOnly) Indicates whether the value of the 'encryptionKey' property has been set. 
* `mod_time`:(string)(ReadOnly) The time when this managed object was last modified. 
* `moid`:(string) The unique identifier of this Managed Object instance. 
* `name`:(string) Name of the concrete policy. 
* `organization`:(HashMap) - A reference to a organizationOrganization resource.When the $expand query parameter is specified, the referenced resource is returned inline.
