# Resource: intersight_softwarerepository_category_mapper
Maps a Cisco software repository image category identifier to its applicable hardware models.
## Usage Example
### Resource Creation

```hcl
resource "intersight_softwarerepository_category_mapper" "softwarerepository_category_mapper1" {
  name      = "softwarerepository_category_mapper1"
  category  = "Integrated Services Routers"
  file_type = "OperatingSystemFile"
}
```
## Argument Reference
The following arguments are supported:
* `account_moid`:(string)(ReadOnly) The Account ID for this managed object. 
* `ancestors`:(Array)(ReadOnly) An array of relationships to moBaseMo resources. 
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `moid`:(string) The Moid of the referenced REST resource. 
  + `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the remote type referred by this relationship. 
  + `selector`:(string) An OData $filter expression which describes the REST resource to be referenced. This field maybe set instead of 'moid' by clients.1. If 'moid' is set this field is ignored.1. If 'selector' is set and 'moid' is empty/absent from the request, Intersight determines the Moid of theresource matching the filter expression and populates it in the MoRef that is part of the objectinstance being inserted/updated to fulfill the REST request.An error is returned if the filter matches zero or more than one REST resource.An example filter string is: Serial eq '3AA8B7T11'. 
* `category`:(string) The category of the model series. 
* `create_time`:(string)(ReadOnly) The time when this managed object was created. 
* `domain_group_moid`:(string)(ReadOnly) The DomainGroup ID for this managed object. 
* `file_type`:(string) The type of distributable image, example huu, scu, driver, os.* `Distributable` - Stores firmware host utility images and fabric images.* `DriverDistributable` - Stores driver distributable images.* `ServerConfigurationUtilityDistributable` - Stores server configuration utility images.* `OperatingSystemFile` - Stores operating system iso images.* `HyperflexDistributable` - It stores HyperFlex images. 
* `image_type`:(string) The type of image based on the endpoint it can upgrade. For example, ucs-c420m5-huu-3.2.1a.iso can upgrade standalone servers, so the image type is Standalone Server. 
* `mdf_id`:(string) Cisco software repository image category identifier. 
* `mod_time`:(string)(ReadOnly) The time when this managed object was last modified. 
* `moid`:(string) The unique identifier of this Managed Object instance. 
* `name`:(string) An unique identifer for a capability descriptor. 
* `owners`:
                (Array of schema.TypeString) -(ReadOnly)
* `parent`:(HashMap) -(ReadOnly) A reference to a moBaseMo resource.When the $expand query parameter is specified, the referenced resource is returned inline. 
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `moid`:(string) The Moid of the referenced REST resource. 
  + `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the remote type referred by this relationship. 
  + `selector`:(string) An OData $filter expression which describes the REST resource to be referenced. This field maybe set instead of 'moid' by clients.1. If 'moid' is set this field is ignored.1. If 'selector' is set and 'moid' is empty/absent from the request, Intersight determines the Moid of theresource matching the filter expression and populates it in the MoRef that is part of the objectinstance being inserted/updated to fulfill the REST request.An error is returned if the filter matches zero or more than one REST resource.An example filter string is: Serial eq '3AA8B7T11'. 
* `permission_resources`:(Array)(ReadOnly) An array of relationships to moBaseMo resources. 
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `moid`:(string) The Moid of the referenced REST resource. 
  + `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the remote type referred by this relationship. 
  + `selector`:(string) An OData $filter expression which describes the REST resource to be referenced. This field maybe set instead of 'moid' by clients.1. If 'moid' is set this field is ignored.1. If 'selector' is set and 'moid' is empty/absent from the request, Intersight determines the Moid of theresource matching the filter expression and populates it in the MoRef that is part of the objectinstance being inserted/updated to fulfill the REST request.An error is returned if the filter matches zero or more than one REST resource.An example filter string is: Serial eq '3AA8B7T11'. 
* `regex_pattern`:(string) The regex that all images of this category follow. 
* `shared_scope`:(string)(ReadOnly) Intersight provides pre-built workflows, tasks and policies to end users through global catalogs.Objects that are made available through global catalogs are said to have a 'shared' ownership. Shared objects are either made globally available to all end users or restricted to end users based on their license entitlement. Users can use this property to differentiate the scope (global or a specific license tier) to which a shared MO belongs. 
* `nr_source`:(string) The image can be downloaded from cisco.com or external cloud store.* `Cisco` - External repository hosted on cisco.com.* `IntersightCloud` - Repository hosted by the Intersight Cloud.* `LocalMachine` - The file is available on the local client machine. Used as an upload source type.* `NetworkShare` - External repository in the customer datacenter. This will typically be a file server. 
* `supported_models`:
                (Array of schema.TypeString) -
* `sw_id`:(string) The software type id provided by cisco.com. 
* `tag_types`:
                (Array of schema.TypeString) -
* `tags`:(Array)
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `key`:(string) The string representation of a tag key. 
  + `value`:(string) The string representation of a tag value. 
* `nr_version`:(string) The version from which user can download images from amazon store, if source is external cloud store. 
* `version_context`:(HashMap) -(ReadOnly) The versioning info for this managed object.
