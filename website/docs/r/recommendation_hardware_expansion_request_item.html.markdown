# Resource: intersight_recommendation_hardware_expansion_request_item
Entity representing the user request for expansion of each hardware item.
## Argument Reference
The following arguments are supported:
* `account_moid`:(string)(ReadOnly) The Account ID for this managed object. 
* `ancestors`:(Array)(ReadOnly) An array of relationships to moBaseMo resources. 
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `moid`:(string) The Moid of the referenced REST resource. 
  + `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the remote type referred by this relationship. 
  + `selector`:(string) An OData $filter expression which describes the REST resource to be referenced. This field maybe set instead of 'moid' by clients.1. If 'moid' is set this field is ignored.1. If 'selector' is set and 'moid' is empty/absent from the request, Intersight determines the Moid of theresource matching the filter expression and populates it in the MoRef that is part of the objectinstance being inserted/updated to fulfill the REST request.An error is returned if the filter matches zero or more than one REST resource.An example filter string is: Serial eq '3AA8B7T11'. 
* `create_time`:(string)(ReadOnly) The time when this managed object was created. 
* `domain_group_moid`:(string)(ReadOnly) The DomainGroup ID for this managed object. 
* `expansion_request`:(HashMap) -(ReadOnly) A reference to a recommendationHardwareExpansionRequest resource.When the $expand query parameter is specified, the referenced resource is returned inline.

* `item_type`:(string) Type of hardware item for which the capacity increase is requested by the user. For example, CPU.* `None` - The Enum value None represents that no value was set for the hardware type.* `CPU` - The Enum value CPU represents that the hardware type requested for expansion is a physical CPU.* `Memory` - The Enum value Memory represents that the hardware type requested for expansion is a memory unit.* `Storage` - The Enum value Storage represents that the hardware type requested for expansion is a storage unit, ie, storage drives. 
* `max_value`:(float) The maximum value allowed for expansion for the hardware type on the referred registered device. 
* `max_value_unit`:(string) Unit type for the maximum value of the resource. For example, TB, GB, MB.* `TB` - The Enum value TB represents that the measurement unit is in terabytes.* `MB` - The Enum value MB represents that the measurement unit is in megabytes.* `GB` - The Enum value GB represents that the measurement unit is in gigabytes.* `MHz` - The Enum value MHz represents that the measurement unit is in megahertz.* `GHz` - The Enum value GHz represents that the measurement unit is in gigahertz.* `Percentage` - The Enum value Percentage represents that the expansion request is in the percentage of resource increase. For example, a 20% increase in CPU capacity. 
* `mod_time`:(string)(ReadOnly) The time when this managed object was last modified. 
* `moid`:(string) The unique identifier of this Managed Object instance. 
* `owners`:
                (Array of schema.TypeString) -(ReadOnly)
* `parent`:(HashMap) -(ReadOnly) A reference to a moBaseMo resource.When the $expand query parameter is specified, the referenced resource is returned inline.

If 'selector' is set and 'moid' is empty/absent from the request, Intersight determines the Moid of theresource matching the filter expression and populates it in the MoRef that is part of the objectinstance being inserted/updated to fulfill the REST request.An error is returned if the filter matches zero or more than one REST resource.An example filter string is: Serial eq '3AA8B7T11'. 
* `permission_resources`:(Array)(ReadOnly) An array of relationships to moBaseMo resources. 
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `moid`:(string) The Moid of the referenced REST resource. 
  + `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the remote type referred by this relationship.

* `shared_scope`:(string)(ReadOnly) Intersight provides pre-built workflows, tasks and policies to end users through global catalogs.Objects that are made available through global catalogs are said to have a 'shared' ownership. Shared objects are either made globally available to all end users or restricted to end users based on their license entitlement. Users can use this property to differentiate the scope (global or a specific license tier) to which a shared MO belongs. 
* `tags`:(Array)
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `key`:(string) The string representation of a tag key. 
  + `value`:(string) The string representation of a tag value.
