  + `alert_type`:(string) Alert type is used to denote the category of an Intersight alert (FieldNotice, equipment Fault etc.).* `psirt` - Respresents the psirt alert type (https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/publicationListing.x).* `fieldNotice` - Respresents the field notice alert type (https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-products-field-notice-summary.html).* `eolAdvisory` - Represents product End of Life (EOL) type (https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html). 
  + `identifiers`:(Array)
This complex property has following sub-properties:
    + `name`:(string) Name of the filter paramter. 
    + `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type.The value should be the same as the 'ClassId' property. 
    + `value`:(string) Value of the filter paramter. 
  + `name`:(string) Uniquely identifies a given action among the set of actions corresponding to an advisory. Primarily used to store and compare results of subsequent iterations corresponding to the action queries. 
  + `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type.The value should be the same as the 'ClassId' property. 
  + `operation_type`:(string) Operation type for the alert action. An action is used to carry out the process of \ reacting\  to an alert condition. For e.g.in case of a fieldNotice alert, the intention may be to create a new alert (if the condition matches and there is no existing alert) or to remove an existing alert when the alert condition has been remedied.* `create` - Create an instance of AdvisoryInstance.* `remove` - Remove an instance of AdvisoryInstance. 
  + `queries`:(Array)
This complex property has following sub-properties:
    + `name`:(string) Name is used to unique identify and result of the given query which can be used by subsequent queries as input data source. 
    + `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type.The value should be the same as the 'ClassId' property.
