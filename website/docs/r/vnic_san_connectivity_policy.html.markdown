# Resource: intersight_vnic._san_connectivity_policy
SAN connectivity policy determines the network storage resources and the connections between the server and the SAN on the network. This policy enables configuration of vHBAs that the servers use to communicate with the storage network.
## Argument Reference
The following arguments are supported:
* `additional_properties`:
(Array with Maximum of one item) - Add additional properties in json format inside `jsonencode()` for this object.
* `class_id`:(string)(Computed) The concrete type of this complex type. Its value must be the same as the 'objectType' property.The OpenAPI document references this property as a discriminator value. 
* `description`:(string) Description of the policy. 
* `fc_ifs`:(Array) An array of relationships to vnicFcIf resources. 
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `additional_properties`:
(Array with Maximum of one item) - Add additional properties in json format inside `jsonencode()` for this object.
  + `class_id`:(string)(Computed) The concrete type of this complex type. Its value must be the same as the 'objectType' property.The OpenAPI document references this property as a discriminator value. 
  + `moid`:(string)(Computed) The Moid of the referenced REST resource. 
  + `object_type`:(string) The concrete type of this complex type.The ObjectType property must be set explicitly by API clients when the type is ambiguous. In all other cases, the ObjectType is optional. The type is ambiguous when a managed object contains an array of nested documents, and the documents in the arrayare heterogeneous, i.e. the array can contain nested documents of different types. 
  + `selector`:(string)(Computed) An OData $filter expression which describes the REST resource to be referenced. This field maybe set instead of 'moid' by clients.1. If 'moid' is set this field is ignored.1. If 'selector' is set and 'moid' is empty/absent from the request, Intersight determines the Moid of theresource matching the filter expression and populates it in the MoRef that is part of the objectinstance being inserted/updated to fulfill the REST request.An error is returned if the filter matches zero or more than one REST resource.An example filter string is: Serial eq '3AA8B7T11'. 
* `moid`:(string) The unique identifier of this Managed Object instance. 
* `name`:(string) Name of the concrete policy. 
* `object_type`:(string)(Computed) The fully-qualified type of this managed object, i.e. the class name.This property is optional. The ObjectType is implied from the URL path.If specified, the value of objectType must match the class name specified in the URL path. 
* `organization`:(Array with Maximum of one item) - A reference to a organizationOrganization resource.When the $expand query parameter is specified, the referenced resource is returned inline.

* `placement_mode`:(string) The mode used for placement of vnics on network adapters. It can either be Auto or Custom.* `custom` - The placement of the vNICs / vHBAs on network adapters is manually chosen by the user.* `auto` - The placement of the vNICs / vHBAs on network adapters is automatically determined by the system. 
* `profiles`:(Array) An array of relationships to policyAbstractConfigProfile resources.

* `tags`:(Array)
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `additional_properties`:
(Array with Maximum of one item) - Add additional properties in json format inside `jsonencode()` for this object.
  + `key`:(string) The string representation of a tag key. 
  + `value`:(string) The string representation of a tag value. 
* `target_platform`:(string) The platform for which the server profile is applicable. It can either be a server that is operating in standalone mode or which is attached to a Fabric Interconnect managed by Intersight.* `Standalone` - Servers which are operating in standalone mode i.e. not connected to a Fabric Interconnected.* `FIAttached` - Servers which are connected to a Fabric Interconnect that is managed by Intersight. 
* `wwnn_pool`:(Array with Maximum of one item) - A reference to a fcpoolPool resource.When the $expand query parameter is specified, the referenced resource is returned inline.
