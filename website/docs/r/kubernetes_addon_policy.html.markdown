# Resource: intersight_kubernetes_addon_policy
A policy that defines which AddonDefinitions to use.
## Usage Example
### Resource Creation

```hcl
resource "intersight_kubernetes_addon_policy" "kubernetes_addon_policy1" {
  description = "kubernetes addon policy"
  name        = "kubernetes_addon_policy1"
  addon_configuration {
    install_strategy = "Always"
    release_name     = "helm-release-3"
    upgrade_strategy = "UpgradeOnly"
    object_type      = "kubernetes.AddonConfiguration"
  }
  addon_definition {
    moid        = intersight_kubernetes_addon_definition.kubernetes_addon_definition1.moid
    object_type = "kubernetes.AddonDefinition"
  }
  organization {
    object_type = "organization.Organization"
    moid        = var.organization
  }
}
```
## Argument Reference
The following arguments are supported:
* `account_moid`:(string)(ReadOnly) The Account ID for this managed object. 
* `addon_configuration`:(HashMap) - Addon configuration settings that are suitable to be shared across clusters. 
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `install_strategy`:(string) Addon install strategy to determine whether an addon is installed if not present.* `None` - Unspecified install strategy.* `NoAction` - No install action performed.* `InstallOnly` - Only install in green field. No action in case of failure or removal.* `Always` - Attempt install if chart is not already installed. 
  + `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type.The value should be the same as the 'ClassId' property. 
  + `override_sets`:(Array)
This complex property has following sub-properties:
    + `key`:(string) Key or property name in a key/value pair.

  + `release_name`:(string) Name for the helm release. 
  + `release_namespace`:(string) Namespace for the helm release. 
  + `upgrade_strategy`:(string) Addon upgrade strategy to determine whether an addon configuration is overwritten on upgrade.* `None` - Unspecified upgrade strategy.* `NoAction` - This choice enables No upgrades to be performed.* `UpgradeOnly` - Attempt upgrade if chart or overrides options change, no action on upgrade failure.* `ReinstallOnFailure` - Attempt upgrade first.
