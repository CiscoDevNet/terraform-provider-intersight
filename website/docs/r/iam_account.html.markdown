# Resource: intersight_iam_account
The Intersight Account used to access Intersight.
## Usage Example
### Resource Creation

```hcl
resource "intersight_iam_account" "account1" {
  name = "iamaccount-1"
   resource_limits {
     moid        = var.iam_resource_limits
     object_type = "iam.ResourceLimits"
   }
   security_holder {
     moid        = var.iam_security_holder
     object_type = "iam.SecurityHolder"
   }
   session_limits {
     moid        = var.iam_session_limits
     object_type = "iam.SessionLimits"
   }
}

 variable "iam_resource_limits" {
   type = string
   description = "value for iam_resource_limits"
 }

 variable "iam_security_holder" {
   type = string
   description = "value for iam_security_holder"
 }

 variable "iam_session_limits" {
   type = string
   description = "value for iam_session_limits"
 }

## Argument Reference
The following arguments are supported:
* `account_moid`:(string)(ReadOnly) The Account ID for this managed object. 
* `ancestors`:(Array)(ReadOnly) An array of relationships to moBaseMo resources. 
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `moid`:(string) The Moid of the referenced REST resource. 
  + `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the remote type referred by this relationship. 
  + `selector`:(string) An OData $filter expression which describes the REST resource to be referenced. This field maybe set instead of 'moid' by clients.1. If 'moid' is set this field is ignored.1. If 'selector' is set and 'moid' is empty/absent from the request, Intersight determines the Moid of theresource matching the filter expression and populates it in the MoRef that is part of the objectinstance being inserted/updated to fulfill the REST request.An error is returned if the filter matches zero or more than one REST resource.An example filter string is: Serial eq '3AA8B7T11'.
