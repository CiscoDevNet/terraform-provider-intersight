# Resource: intersight_capability_switch_manufacturing_def
Switch/Fabric-Interconnect manufacturing def properties.
## Usage Example
### Resource Creation

```hcl
resource "intersight_capability_switch_manufacturing_def" "capability_switch_manufacturing_def1" {
  name         = "capability_switch_manufacturing_def"
  pid          = "UCS-FI-6454"
  sku          = "CON-NCF4P-FI6454CH"
  vid          = "V00"
  caption      = "UCS 6454 1RU FI, with no PSU"
  description  = "Configured model: UCS 6454 1RU FI, with no PSU, with 54 ports and includes 18x10/25-Gbps and 2x40/100-Gbps port licenses"
  part_number  = "UCS-FI-6454"
  product_name = "UCS 6454 1RU FI"
}
```
## Argument Reference
The following arguments are supported:
* `account_moid`:(string)(ReadOnly) The Account ID for this managed object. 
* `ancestors`:(Array)(ReadOnly) An array of relationships to moBaseMo resources. 
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `moid`:(string) The Moid of the referenced REST resource. 
  + `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the remote type referred by this relationship. 
  + `selector`:(string) An OData $filter expression which describes the REST resource to be referenced. This field maybe set instead of 'moid' by clients.1. If 'moid' is set this field is ignored.1. If 'selector' is set and 'moid' is empty/absent from the request, Intersight determines the Moid of theresource matching the filter expression and populates it in the MoRef that is part of the objectinstance being inserted/updated to fulfill the REST request.An error is returned if the filter matches zero or more than one REST resource.An example filter string is: Serial eq '3AA8B7T11'. 
* `caption`:(string) Caption for Switch/Fabric-Interconnect. 
* `create_time`:(string)(ReadOnly) The time when this managed object was created. 
* `description`:(string) Description for Switch/Fabric-Interconnect. 
* `domain_group_moid`:(string)(ReadOnly) The DomainGroup ID for this managed object. 
* `mod_time`:(string)(ReadOnly) The time when this managed object was last modified. 
* `moid`:(string) The unique identifier of this Managed Object instance. 
* `name`:(string) An unique identifer for a capability descriptor. 
* `owners`:
                (Array of schema.TypeString) -(ReadOnly)
* `parent`:(HashMap) -(ReadOnly) A reference to a moBaseMo resource.When the $expand query parameter is specified, the referenced resource is returned inline.

* `product_name`:(string) Product Name for Switch/Fabric-Interconnect. 
* `shared_scope`:(string)(ReadOnly) Intersight provides pre-built workflows, tasks and policies to end users through global catalogs.Objects that are made available through global catalogs are said to have a 'shared' ownership. Shared objects are either made globally available to all end users or restricted to end users based on their license entitlement.
