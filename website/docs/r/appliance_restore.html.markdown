# Resource: intersight_appliance._restore
Restore tracks requests to restore the Intersight Appliance. There will be only
one Restore managed object with a 'Started' state at any time. All other Restore
managed objects will be in terminal states.
## Argument Reference
The following arguments are supported:
* `account`:(Array with Maximum of one item) - A reference to a iamAccount resource.When the $expand query parameter is specified, the referenced resource is returned inline. 
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `additional_properties`:
(Array with Maximum of one item) - Add additional properties in json format inside `jsonencode()` for this object.
  + `class_id`:(string)(Computed) The concrete type of this complex type. Its value must be the same as the 'objectType' property.The OpenAPI document references this property as a discriminator value. 
  + `moid`:(string)(Computed) The Moid of the referenced REST resource. 
  + `object_type`:(string) The concrete type of this complex type.The ObjectType property must be set explicitly by API clients when the type is ambiguous. In all other cases, the ObjectType is optional. The type is ambiguous when a managed object contains an array of nested documents, and the documents in the arrayare heterogeneous, i.e. the array can contain nested documents of different types. 
  + `selector`:(string)(Computed) An OData $filter expression which describes the REST resource to be referenced. This field maybe set instead of 'moid' by clients.1. If 'moid' is set this field is ignored.1. If 'selector' is set and 'moid' is empty/absent from the request, Intersight determines the Moid of theresource matching the filter expression and populates it in the MoRef that is part of the objectinstance being inserted/updated to fulfill the REST request.An error is returned if the filter matches zero or more than one REST resource.An example filter string is: Serial eq '3AA8B7T11'. 
* `additional_properties`:
(Array with Maximum of one item) - Add additional properties in json format inside `jsonencode()` for this object.
* `class_id`:(string)(Computed) The concrete type of this complex type. Its value must be the same as the 'objectType' property.The OpenAPI document references this property as a discriminator value. 
* `elapsed_time`:(int)(Computed) Elapsed time in seconds since the restore process has started. 
* `end_time`:(string)(Computed) End date and time of the restore process. 
* `filename`:(string) Backup filename to backup or restore. 
* `is_password_set`:(bool)(Computed) Indicates whether the value of the 'password' property has been set. 
* `messages`:
                (Array of schema.TypeString) -
* `moid`:(string) The unique identifier of this Managed Object instance. 
* `object_type`:(string)(Computed) The fully-qualified type of this managed object, i.e. the class name.This property is optional. The ObjectType is implied from the URL path.If specified, the value of objectType must match the class name specified in the URL path. 
* `password`:(string) Password for authenticating with the file server. 
* `protocol`:(string) Communication protocol used by the file server (e.g. scp or sftp).* `scp` - Secure Copy Protocol (SCP) to access the file server.* `sftp` - SSH File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) to access file server. 
* `remote_host`:(string) Hostname of the remote file server. 
* `remote_path`:(string) File server directory to copy the file. 
* `remote_port`:(int) Remote TCP port on the file server (e.g. 22 for scp). 
* `start_time`:(string)(Computed) Start date and time of the restore process. 
* `status`:(string)(Computed) Status of the restore managed object.* `Started` - Backup or restore process has started.* `Created` - Backup or restore is in created state.* `Failed` - Backup or restore process has failed.* `Completed` - Backup or restore process has completed.* `Copied` - Backup file has been copied. 
* `tags`:(Array)
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `additional_properties`:
(Array with Maximum of one item) - Add additional properties in json format inside `jsonencode()` for this object.
  + `key`:(string) The string representation of a tag key. 
  + `value`:(string) The string representation of a tag value. 
* `username`:(string) Username to authenticate the fileserver.
