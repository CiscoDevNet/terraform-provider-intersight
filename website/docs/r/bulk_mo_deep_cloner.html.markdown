# Resource: intersight_bulk_mo_deep_cloner
The MODeepCloner interface facilitates making n number of deep copies of any resource instance which supports the CREATE operation.
The MO to be cloned should be specified as an MoRef object in the "Source".
The "Targets" array should contain n JSON documents each compliant to RFC 7386. 
For each target MO to be created, the user can specify the following -
- new values for the identity properties, if applicable
- new values for specific properties or references of the source MO which need to be overridden in the cloned object.
## Argument Reference
The following arguments are supported:
* `account_moid`:(string)(ReadOnly) The Account ID for this managed object. 
* `ancestors`:(Array)(ReadOnly) An array of relationships to moBaseMo resources. 
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `moid`:(string) The Moid of the referenced REST resource. 
  + `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the remote type referred by this relationship. 
  + `selector`:(string) An OData $filter expression which describes the REST resource to be referenced. This field maybe set instead of 'moid' by clients.1. If 'moid' is set this field is ignored.1. If 'selector' is set and 'moid' is empty/absent from the request, Intersight determines the Moid of theresource matching the filter expression and populates it in the MoRef that is part of the objectinstance being inserted/updated to fulfill the REST request.An error is returned if the filter matches zero or more than one REST resource.An example filter string is: Serial eq '3AA8B7T11'.
