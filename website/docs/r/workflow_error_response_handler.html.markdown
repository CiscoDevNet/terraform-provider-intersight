  Intersight allows generic API tasks to be created by taking the API request
body and a response parser specification in the form of content.Grammar object.
Error Response Handler allows to create a generic error response specification
which can be used by multiple Batch API. The parameters provided in the Error
Response Handler may be used to parse error responses from an API request, if
the response specification provided for the API request does not define
error parameters.

# Resource: intersight_workflow_error_response_handler
Intersight allows generic API tasks to be created by taking the API request
body and a response parser specification in the form of content.Grammar object.
Error Response Handler allows to create a generic error response specification
which can be used by multiple Batch API. The parameters provided in the Error
Response Handler may be used to parse error responses from an API request, if
the response specification provided for the API request does not define
error parameters.
## Argument Reference
The following arguments are supported:
* `catalog`:(HashMap) - A reference to a workflowCatalog resource.When the $expand query parameter is specified, the referenced resource is returned inline. 
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `moid`:(string)(Computed) The Moid of the referenced REST resource. 
  + `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the remote type referred by this relationship. 
  + `selector`:(string)(Computed) An OData $filter expression which describes the REST resource to be referenced. This field maybe set instead of 'moid' by clients.1. If 'moid' is set this field is ignored.1. If 'selector' is set and 'moid' is empty/absent from the request, Intersight determines the Moid of theresource matching the filter expression and populates it in the MoRef that is part of the objectinstance being inserted/updated to fulfill the REST request.An error is returned if the filter matches zero or more than one REST resource.An example filter string is: Serial eq '3AA8B7T11'. 
* `description`:(string) A detailed description about the error response handler.
