# Resource: intersight_hyperflex_cluster_storage_policy
A policy specifying HyperFlex cluster storage settings (optional).
## Usage Example
### Resource Creation

```hcl
resource "intersight_hyperflex_cluster_storage_policy" "hyperflex_cluster_storage_policy1" {
  disk_partition_cleanup = true
  vdi_optimization       = true
  logical_avalability_zone_config = {
    auto_config = false
  }
  organization {
    object_type = "organization.Organization"
    moid        = var.organization_organization
  }
  name = "hyperflex_cluster_storage_policy1"
}
```
## Argument Reference
The following arguments are supported:
* `account_moid`:(string)(ReadOnly) The Account ID for this managed object. 
* `ancestors`:(Array)(ReadOnly) An array of relationships to moBaseMo resources. 
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `moid`:(string) The Moid of the referenced REST resource. 
  + `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the remote type referred by this relationship. 
  + `selector`:(string) An OData $filter expression which describes the REST resource to be referenced. This field maybe set instead of 'moid' by clients.1. If 'moid' is set this field is ignored.1. If 'selector' is set and 'moid' is empty/absent from the request, Intersight determines the Moid of theresource matching the filter expression and populates it in the MoRef that is part of the objectinstance being inserted/updated to fulfill the REST request.An error is returned if the filter matches zero or more than one REST resource.An example filter string is: Serial eq '3AA8B7T11'. 
* `cluster_profiles`:(Array) An array of relationships to hyperflexClusterProfile resources. 
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `moid`:(string) The Moid of the referenced REST resource. 
  + `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the remote type referred by this relationship. 
  + `selector`:(string) An OData $filter expression which describes the REST resource to be referenced. This field maybe set instead of 'moid' by clients.1. If 'moid' is set this field is ignored.1. If 'selector' is set and 'moid' is empty/absent from the request, Intersight determines the Moid of theresource matching the filter expression and populates it in the MoRef that is part of the objectinstance being inserted/updated to fulfill the REST request.An error is returned if the filter matches zero or more than one REST resource.An example filter string is: Serial eq '3AA8B7T11'. 
* `create_time`:(string)(ReadOnly) The time when this managed object was created. 
* `description`:(string) Description of the policy. 
* `disk_partition_cleanup`:(bool) If enabled, formats existing disk partitions (destroys all user data). 
* `domain_group_moid`:(string)(ReadOnly) The DomainGroup ID for this managed object. 
* `logical_avalability_zone_config`:(HashMap) - Enable or disable Logical Availability Zones (LAZ). If enabled, HyperFlex Data Platform automatically selects and groups nodes into different availability zones. For HyperFlex Data Platform versions prior to 3.0 release, this setting does not apply. For HyperFlex Data Platform versions 3.0 or higher, this setting is only applicable to Fabric Interconnect attached HyperFlex systems with 8 or more converged nodes.

* `name`:(string) Name of the concrete policy. 
* `organization`:(HashMap) - A reference to a organizationOrganization resource.When the $expand query parameter is specified, the referenced resource is returned inline.
