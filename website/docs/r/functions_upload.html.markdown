# Resource: intersight_functions_upload
The managed object which has info about uploaded file.
## Argument Reference
The following arguments are supported:
* `account_moid`:(string)(ReadOnly) The Account ID for this managed object. 
* `action`:(string) Action against the Upload.* `None` - No action is set, this is the default value for action field.* `CompleteUploading` - Mark the instance of a Upload as uploaded. 
* `ancestors`:(Array)(ReadOnly) An array of relationships to moBaseMo resources. 
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `moid`:(string) The Moid of the referenced REST resource. 
  + `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the remote type referred by this relationship. 
  + `selector`:(string) An OData $filter expression which describes the REST resource to be referenced. This field maybe set instead of 'moid' by clients.1. If 'moid' is set this field is ignored.1. If 'selector' is set and 'moid' is empty/absent from the request, Intersight determines the Moid of theresource matching the filter expression and populates it in the MoRef that is part of the objectinstance being inserted/updated to fulfill the REST request.An error is returned if the filter matches zero or more than one REST resource.An example filter string is: Serial eq '3AA8B7T11'. 
* `create_time`:(string)(ReadOnly) The time when this managed object was created. 
* `create_user`:(string)(ReadOnly) The user identifier who created the Upload. 
* `description`:(string) Description of the Upload. 
* `domain_group_moid`:(string)(ReadOnly) The DomainGroup ID for this managed object. 
* `file_name`:(string) The file name of the Upload. File name can only contain letters (a-z, A-Z), numbers (0-9), hyphen (-), period (.) or an underscore (_). 
* `file_size`:(int) The size (in bytes) of the file. 
* `mod_time`:(string)(ReadOnly) The time when this managed object was last modified. 
* `mod_user`:(string)(ReadOnly) The user identifier who last updated the Upload. 
* `moid`:(string) The unique identifier of this Managed Object instance. 
* `name`:(string) The name of the Upload. Name can only contain letters (a-z, A-Z), numbers (0-9), hyphen (-), period (.) or an underscore (_). 
* `organization`:(HashMap) - A reference to a organizationOrganization resource.When the $expand query parameter is specified, the referenced resource is returned inline.

If 'selector' is set and 'moid' is empty/absent from the request, Intersight determines the Moid of theresource matching the filter expression and populates it in the MoRef that is part of the objectinstance being inserted/updated to fulfill the REST request.An error is returned if the filter matches zero or more than one REST resource.An example filter string is: Serial eq '3AA8B7T11'.

* `shared_scope`:(string)(ReadOnly) Intersight provides pre-built workflows, tasks and policies to end users through global catalogs.Objects that are made available through global catalogs are said to have a 'shared' ownership.
