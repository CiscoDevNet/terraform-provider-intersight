Definition to capture the details needed to execute an action on the service item.
## Argument Reference
The following arguments are supported:
* `account_moid`:(string)(ReadOnly) The Account ID for this managed object. 
* `action_properties`:(HashMap) - Action properties for the service item. 
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type.The value should be the same as the 'ClassId' property. 
  + `operation_type`:(string) Type of action operation to be executed on the service item.* `PostDeployment` - This represents the post-deployment actions for the resources created or defined through the deployment action. There can be more than one post-deployment operations associated with a service item.* `Deployment` - This represents the deploy action, for the service item action definition. This operation type is used to create or define resources that is managed by the service item. There can only be one Service Item Action Definition that can be marked with the operation type as Deployment and this is a mandatory operation type. All valid Service Items must have one and only one operation type marked as type Deployment.* `Decommission` - This represents the decommission action, used to decommission the created resources. All valid Service Items must have one and only one operation type marked as type Decommission. Once a decommission action is run on a Service Item, no further operations are allowed on that Service Item. 
  + `stop_on_failure`:(bool) When true, the action on the service item will be stopped when it reaches a failure by either calling the configured stop workflow or by calling the rollback workflow. By default value is set to true. 
* `action_type`:(string) Type of actionDefinition which decides on how to trigger the action.* `External` - External actions definition can be triggered by enduser to perform actions on the service item. Once action is completed successfully (eg. create/deploy), user cannot re-trigger that action again.* `Internal` - Internal action definition is used to trigger periodic actions on the service item instance.* `Repetitive` - Repetitive action definition is an external action that can be triggered by enduser to perform repetitive actions (eg. Edit/Update/Perform health check) on the created service item.
