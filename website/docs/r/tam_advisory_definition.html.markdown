An Intersight Advisory. An advisory represents an identification of a potential issue and may also include  a recommendation for resolving the said issue. Advisories may be of different kind and severity. for e.g. It could be a security vulnerability or a performance issue or a hardware issue with different recommendations for resolving them.
## Argument Reference
The following arguments are supported:
* `actions`:(Array)
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `additional_properties`:
(Array with Maximum of one item) - Add additional properties in json format inside `jsonencode()` for this object.
