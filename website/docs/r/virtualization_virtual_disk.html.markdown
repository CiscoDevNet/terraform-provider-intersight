Depicts disk configuration used to be create a virtual disk on a hypervisor datastore.
## Usage Example
### Resource Creation

```hcl
resource "intersight_virtualization_virtual_disk" "virtualization_virtual_disk1" {
  #name                 = "virtualization_virtual_disk1"
  name                 = "vIAjZv26eq"
  source_certs         = "<Base64 encoded CA certificates of the https source>"
  source_disk_to_clone = "<Source disk from which the content is copied>"
  source_file_path     = "<image_path>.ova"
   cluster {
     object_type = "virtualization.BaseCluster.relationship"
     moid        = var.virtualization_BaseCluster_relastionship
   }
   inventory {
     object_type = "virtualization.BaseVirtualDisk.relationship"
     moid        = var.virtualization_base_virtual_disk_relationship
   }

## Argument Reference
The following arguments are supported:
