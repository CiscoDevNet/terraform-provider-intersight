## Argument Reference
The following arguments are supported:
* `access_community_string`:(string) The default SNMPv1, SNMPv2c community name or SNMPv3 username to include on any trap messages sent to the SNMP host. The name can be 32 characters long.

If 'selector' is set and 'moid' is empty/absent from the request, Intersight determines the Moid of theresource matching the filter expression and populates it in the MoRef that is part of the objectinstance being inserted/updated to fulfill the REST request.An error is returned if the filter matches zero or more than one REST resource.An example filter string is: Serial eq '3AA8B7T11'.
