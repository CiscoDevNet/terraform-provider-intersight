# Resource: intersight_snmp._policy
Policy to configure SNMP settings on endpoint.
## Argument Reference
The following arguments are supported:
* `access_community_string`:(string) The default SNMPv1, SNMPv2c community name or SNMPv3 username to include on any trap messages sent to the SNMP host. The name can be 18 characters long. 
* `additional_properties`:
(Array with Maximum of one item) - Add additional properties in json format inside `jsonencode()` for this object.
* `class_id`:(string)(Computed) The concrete type of this complex type. Its value must be the same as the 'objectType' property.The OpenAPI document references this property as a discriminator value. 
* `community_access`:(string) Controls access to the information in the inventory tables. Applicable only for SNMPv1 and SNMPv2c users.* `Disabled` - Blocks access to the information in the inventory tables.* `Limited` - Partial access to read the information in the inventory tables.* `Full` - Full access to read the information in the inventory tables. 
* `description`:(string) Description of the policy. 
* `enabled`:(bool) State of the SNMP Policy on the endpoint. If enabled, the endpoint sends SNMP traps to the designated host. 
* `engine_id`:(string) User-defined unique identification of the static engine. 
* `moid`:(string) The unique identifier of this Managed Object instance. 
* `name`:(string) Name of the concrete policy. 
* `object_type`:(string)(Computed) The fully-qualified type of this managed object, i.e. the class name.This property is optional. The ObjectType is implied from the URL path.If specified, the value of objectType must match the class name specified in the URL path. 
* `organization`:(Array with Maximum of one item) - A reference to a organizationOrganization resource.When the $expand query parameter is specified, the referenced resource is returned inline. 
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `additional_properties`:
(Array with Maximum of one item) - Add additional properties in json format inside `jsonencode()` for this object.
  + `class_id`:(string)(Computed) The concrete type of this complex type. Its value must be the same as the 'objectType' property.The OpenAPI document references this property as a discriminator value. 
  + `moid`:(string)(Computed) The Moid of the referenced REST resource. 
  + `object_type`:(string) The concrete type of this complex type.The ObjectType property must be set explicitly by API clients when the type is ambiguous. In all other cases, the ObjectType is optional. The type is ambiguous when a managed object contains an array of nested documents, and the documents in the arrayare heterogeneous, i.e. the array can contain nested documents of different types. 
  + `selector`:(string)(Computed) An OData $filter expression which describes the REST resource to be referenced. This field maybe set instead of 'moid' by clients.1. If 'moid' is set this field is ignored.1. If 'selector' is set and 'moid' is empty/absent from the request, Intersight determines the Moid of theresource matching the filter expression and populates it in the MoRef that is part of the objectinstance being inserted/updated to fulfill the REST request.An error is returned if the filter matches zero or more than one REST resource.An example filter string is: Serial eq '3AA8B7T11'. 
* `profiles`:(Array) An array of relationships to policyAbstractConfigProfile resources. 
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `additional_properties`:
(Array with Maximum of one item) - Add additional properties in json format inside `jsonencode()` for this object.
  + `class_id`:(string)(Computed) The concrete type of this complex type. Its value must be the same as the 'objectType' property.The OpenAPI document references this property as a discriminator value. 
  + `moid`:(string)(Computed) The Moid of the referenced REST resource. 
  + `object_type`:(string) The concrete type of this complex type.The ObjectType property must be set explicitly by API clients when the type is ambiguous. In all other cases, the ObjectType is optional. The type is ambiguous when a managed object contains an array of nested documents, and the documents in the arrayare heterogeneous, i.e. the array can contain nested documents of different types.

* `snmp_port`:(int) Port on which Cisco IMC SNMP agent runs. 
* `snmp_traps`:(Array)
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `additional_properties`:
(Array with Maximum of one item) - Add additional properties in json format inside `jsonencode()` for this object.
  + `class_id`:(string)(Computed) The concrete type of this complex type. Its value must be the same as the 'objectType' property.The OpenAPI document references this property as a discriminator value. 
  + `destination`:(string) Address to which the SNMP trap information is sent. 
  + `enabled`:(bool) Enables/disables the trap on the server If enabled, trap is active on the server. 
  + `object_type`:(string) The concrete type of this complex type.The ObjectType property must be set explicitly by API clients when the type is ambiguous. In all other cases, the ObjectType is optional. The type is ambiguous when a managed object contains an array of nested documents, and the documents in the arrayare heterogeneous, i.e. the array can contain nested documents of different types. 
  + `port`:(int) Port used by the server to communicate with trap destination. Enter a value between 1-65535. 
  + `type`:(string) Type of trap which decides whether to receive a notification when a trap is received at the destination.* `Trap` - Do not receive notifications when trap is sent to the destination.* `Inform` - Receive notifications when trap is sent to the destination. This option is valid only for V2 users.

  + `privacy_type`:(string) Privacy protocol for the user.* `NA` - Privacy protocol is not applicable.* `DES` - DES privacy protocol is used for SNMP user.* `AES` - AES privacy protocol is used for SNMP user. 
  + `security_level`:(string) Security mechanism used for communication between agent and manager.* `AuthPriv` - The user requires both an authorization password and a privacy password.* `NoAuthNoPriv` - The user does not require an authorization or privacy password.* `AuthNoPriv` - The user requires an authorization password but not a privacy password.
