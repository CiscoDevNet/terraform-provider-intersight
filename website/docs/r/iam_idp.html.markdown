# Resource: intersight_iam_idp
The SAML identity provider such as Cisco, that has been used to log in to Intersight.
## Usage Example
### Resource Creation

```hcl
resource "intersight_iam_idp" "idp1" {
  domain_name          = "cisco.com"
  enable_single_logout = true
  name                 = "Cisco"
   account {
     object_type = "iam.Account"
     moid        = var.iam_account
   }
   parent {
     moid        = var.iam_system
     object_type = "iam.System"
   }
   system {
     moid        = var.iam_system
     object_type = "iam.System"
   }
  type = "saml"
}


 variable "iam_system" {
   type = string
   description = "value for iam system"
 }

 variable "iam_account" {
   type = string
   description = "value for iam account"
 }
```
## Argument Reference
The following arguments are supported:
* `account`:(HashMap) -(ReadOnly) A reference to a iamAccount resource.When the $expand query parameter is specified, the referenced resource is returned inline. 
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `moid`:(string) The Moid of the referenced REST resource. 
  + `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the remote type referred by this relationship. 
  + `selector`:(string) An OData $filter expression which describes the REST resource to be referenced. This field maybe set instead of 'moid' by clients.1. If 'moid' is set this field is ignored.1. If 'selector' is set and 'moid' is empty/absent from the request, Intersight determines the Moid of theresource matching the filter expression and populates it in the MoRef that is part of the objectinstance being inserted/updated to fulfill the REST request.An error is returned if the filter matches zero or more than one REST resource.An example filter string is: Serial eq '3AA8B7T11'. 
* `account_moid`:(string)(ReadOnly) The Account ID for this managed object. 
* `ancestors`:(Array)(ReadOnly) An array of relationships to moBaseMo resources.
