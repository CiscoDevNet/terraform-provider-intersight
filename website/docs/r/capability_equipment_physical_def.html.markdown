# Resource: intersight_capability_equipment_physical_def
Type to represent additional switch specific capabilities.
## Usage Example
### Resource Creation

```hcl
resource "intersight_capability_equipment_physical_def" "capability_equipment_physical_def1" {
  name          = "capability_equipment_physical_def1"
  pid           = "UCS-FI-6454"
  sku           = "CON-NCF4P-FI6454CH"
  depth         = 57.1
  height        = 4.4
  max_power     = 650
  nominal_power = 260
  weight        = 10.10
  width         = 43.9
}
```
## Argument Reference
The following arguments are supported:
* `account_moid`:(string)(ReadOnly) The Account ID for this managed object. 
* `ancestors`:(Array)(ReadOnly) An array of relationships to moBaseMo resources. 
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `moid`:(string) The Moid of the referenced REST resource. 
  + `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the remote type referred by this relationship. 
  + `selector`:(string) An OData $filter expression which describes the REST resource to be referenced. This field maybe set instead of 'moid' by clients.1. If 'moid' is set this field is ignored.1. If 'selector' is set and 'moid' is empty/absent from the request, Intersight determines the Moid of theresource matching the filter expression and populates it in the MoRef that is part of the objectinstance being inserted/updated to fulfill the REST request.An error is returned if the filter matches zero or more than one REST resource.An example filter string is: Serial eq '3AA8B7T11'. 
* `create_time`:(string)(ReadOnly) The time when this managed object was created. 
* `depth`:(float) Depth information for a Switch/Fabric-Interconnect. 
* `domain_group_moid`:(string)(ReadOnly) The DomainGroup ID for this managed object. 
* `height`:(float) Height information for a Switch/Fabric-Interconnect. 
* `max_power`:(int) Max Power information for a Switch/Fabric-Interconnect. 
* `min_power`:(int) Min Power information for a Switch/Fabric-Interconnect. 
* `mod_time`:(string)(ReadOnly) The time when this managed object was last modified. 
* `moid`:(string) The unique identifier of this Managed Object instance. 
* `name`:(string) An unique identifer for a capability descriptor. 
* `nominal_power`:(int) Nominal Power information for a Switch/Fabric-Interconnect. 
* `owners`:
                (Array of schema.TypeString) -(ReadOnly)
* `parent`:(HashMap) -(ReadOnly) A reference to a moBaseMo resource.When the $expand query parameter is specified, the referenced resource is returned inline. 
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `moid`:(string) The Moid of the referenced REST resource. 
  + `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the remote type referred by this relationship.

* `pid`:(string) Product Identifier for a Switch/Fabric-Interconnect.* `UCS-FI-6454` - The standard 4th generation UCS Fabric Interconnect with 54 ports.* `UCS-FI-64108` - The expanded 4th generation UCS Fabric Interconnect with 108 ports.* `UCS-FI-6536` - The standard 5th generation UCS Fabric Interconnect with 36 ports.* `UCSX-S9108-100G` - Cisco UCS Fabric Interconnect 9108 100G with 8 ports.* `UCS-FI-6664` - The standard 6th generation UCS Fabric Interconnect with 64 ports.* `unknown` - Unknown device type, usage is TBD. 
* `shared_scope`:(string)(ReadOnly) Intersight provides pre-built workflows, tasks and policies to end users through global catalogs.Objects that are made available through global catalogs are said to have a 'shared' ownership. Shared objects are either made globally available to all end users or restricted to end users based on their license entitlement. Users can use this property to differentiate the scope (global or a specific license tier) to which a shared MO belongs.
