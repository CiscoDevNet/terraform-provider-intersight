# Resource: intersight_partnerintegration_device_connector
Recipe for device connector build and deploy.
## Argument Reference
The following arguments are supported:
* `account_moid`:(string)(ReadOnly) The Account ID for this managed object. 
* `action`:(string) Action to be performed on the device connector recipe.* `None` - Default Value of the action, i.e. do nothing.* `Build` - Build the device connector service image.* `Deploy` - Deploy the device connector service on the appliance.* `Upload` - Upload a file to the Partner Integration Appliance bucket. 
* `ancestors`:(Array)(ReadOnly) An array of relationships to moBaseMo resources. 
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `moid`:(string) The Moid of the referenced REST resource. 
  + `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the remote type referred by this relationship. 
  + `selector`:(string) An OData $filter expression which describes the REST resource to be referenced. This field maybe set instead of 'moid' by clients.1. If 'moid' is set this field is ignored.1. If 'selector' is set and 'moid' is empty/absent from the request, Intersight determines the Moid of theresource matching the filter expression and populates it in the MoRef that is part of the objectinstance being inserted/updated to fulfill the REST request.An error is returned if the filter matches zero or more than one REST resource.An example filter string is: Serial eq '3AA8B7T11'. 
* `build_start_time`:(string)(ReadOnly) Time when build was triggered. 
* `build_status`:(string)(ReadOnly) Status of build for device connector recipe.* `None` - Default value of the status. i.e. done nothing.* `BackendInProgress` - The backend build is in progress.* `BackendFailed` - The backend build has failed.* `DockerInProgress` - The docker build is in progress.* `DockerFailed` - The docker build has failed.* `Completed` - The operation completed successfully. 
* `create_time`:(string)(ReadOnly) The time when this managed object was created. 
* `domain_group_moid`:(string)(ReadOnly) The DomainGroup ID for this managed object. 
* `image_name`:(string)(ReadOnly) Name of the docker image that is built. 
* `logs`:(Array)(ReadOnly) An array of relationships to partnerintegrationDcLogs resources.
