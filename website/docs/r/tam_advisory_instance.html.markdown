        ### Overview
        The AdvisoryInstance object represents instances of advisories applicable to Intersight managed objects,
        maintaining advisory applicability and state changes.
        #### Purpose
        AdvisoryInstance tracks the lifecycle and applicability of advisories for specific managed objects,
        ensuring users have visibility into which devices or components are impacted and require resolution.
        #### Key Concepts
        - **Lifecycle Tracking** - Maintains records of advisory applicability, including state changes over time.
        - **Managed Object Integration** - Directly links advisories to affected managed objects for precise applicability.
        - **Controlled Access** - Provides access and management capabilities based on administrative privileges.

### Overview
The AdvisoryInstance object represents instances of advisories applicable to Intersight managed objects,  
maintaining advisory applicability and state changes.
#### Purpose
AdvisoryInstance tracks the lifecycle and applicability of advisories for specific managed objects,  
ensuring users have visibility into which devices or components are impacted and require resolution.
#### Key Concepts
- **Lifecycle Tracking** - Maintains records of advisory applicability, including state changes over time.
- **Managed Object Integration** - Directly links advisories to affected managed objects for precise applicability.
- **Controlled Access** - Provides access and management capabilities based on administrative privileges.
## Usage Example
### Resource Creation

```hcl
resource "intersight_tam_advisory_instance" "tam_tam_advisory_instance" {
  state = "cleared"
}
```
## Argument Reference
The following arguments are supported:
* `account_moid`:(string)(ReadOnly) The Account ID for this managed object. 
* `advisory`:(HashMap) - A reference to a tamBaseAdvisory resource.When the $expand query parameter is specified, the referenced resource is returned inline. 
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `moid`:(string) The Moid of the referenced REST resource. 
  + `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the remote type referred by this relationship. 
  + `selector`:(string) An OData $filter expression which describes the REST resource to be referenced. This field maybe set instead of 'moid' by clients.1. If 'moid' is set this field is ignored.1. If 'selector' is set and 'moid' is empty/absent from the request, Intersight determines the Moid of theresource matching the filter expression and populates it in the MoRef that is part of the objectinstance being inserted/updated to fulfill the REST request.An error is returned if the filter matches zero or more than one REST resource.An example filter string is: Serial eq '3AA8B7T11'.
