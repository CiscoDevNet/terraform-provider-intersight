# Resource: intersight_tam_advisory_instance
Instance of an Intersight advisory applicable for an Intersight managed object. An advisory instance is created when a given advisory is found applicable for an Intersight managed object. An advisory instance is retained for some time even after being cleared for historical purposes. A 'cleared' advisory instance is deleted after the retention time is elaspsed.
## Usage Example
### Resource Creation

```hcl
resource "intersight_tam_advisory_instance" "tam_tam_advisory_instance" {
  state = "cleared"
}
```
## Argument Reference
The following arguments are supported:
* `account_moid`:(string)(ReadOnly) The Account ID for this managed object. 
* `advisory`:(HashMap) - A reference to a tamBaseAdvisory resource.When the $expand query parameter is specified, the referenced resource is returned inline. 
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `moid`:(string) The Moid of the referenced REST resource. 
  + `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the remote type referred by this relationship. 
  + `selector`:(string) An OData $filter expression which describes the REST resource to be referenced. This field maybe set instead of 'moid' by clients.1. If 'moid' is set this field is ignored.1. If 'selector' is set and 'moid' is empty/absent from the request, Intersight determines the Moid of theresource matching the filter expression and populates it in the MoRef that is part of the objectinstance being inserted/updated to fulfill the REST request.An error is returned if the filter matches zero or more than one REST resource.An example filter string is: Serial eq '3AA8B7T11'. 
* `affected_object`:(HashMap) -(ReadOnly) A reference to a moBaseMo resource.When the $expand query parameter is specified, the referenced resource is returned inline.
