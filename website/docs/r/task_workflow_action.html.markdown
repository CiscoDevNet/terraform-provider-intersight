# Resource: intersight_task_workflow_action
Start a test workflow using this object.
## Argument Reference
The following arguments are supported:
* `account`:(HashMap) -(ReadOnly) A reference to a iamAccount resource.When the $expand query parameter is specified, the referenced resource is returned inline. 
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `moid`:(string) The Moid of the referenced REST resource. 
  + `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the remote type referred by this relationship. 
  + `selector`:(string) An OData $filter expression which describes the REST resource to be referenced. This field maybe set instead of 'moid' by clients.1. If 'moid' is set this field is ignored.1. If 'selector' is set and 'moid' is empty/absent from the request, Intersight determines the Moid of theresource matching the filter expression and populates it in the MoRef that is part of the objectinstance being inserted/updated to fulfill the REST request.An error is returned if the filter matches zero or more than one REST resource.An example filter string is: Serial eq '3AA8B7T11'. 
* `account_moid`:(string)(ReadOnly) The Account ID for this managed object. 
* `action`:(string) Action for test workflow.* `start` - Start action for the workflow.* `stop` - Stop action for the workflow. 
* `ancestors`:(Array)(ReadOnly) An array of relationships to moBaseMo resources. 
This complex property has following sub-properties:

* `input_params`:(string) Json formatted string input parameters to workflow. 
* `is_dynamic`:(bool) When true, this workflow type will be triggered as a dynamic workflow, if not it will be treated as a static workflow. 
* `mod_time`:(string)(ReadOnly) The time when this managed object was last modified. 
* `moid`:(string) The unique identifier of this Managed Object instance. 
* `owners`:
                (Array of schema.TypeString) -(ReadOnly)

This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `moid`:(string) The Moid of the referenced REST resource. 
  + `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the remote type referred by this relationship. 
  + `selector`:(string) An OData $filter expression which describes the REST resource to be referenced. This field maybe set instead of 'moid' by clients.1. If 'moid' is set this field is ignored.1. If 'selector' is set and 'moid' is empty/absent from the request, Intersight determines the Moid of theresource matching the filter expression and populates it in the MoRef that is part of the objectinstance being inserted/updated to fulfill the REST request.An error is returned if the filter matches zero or more than one REST resource.An example filter string is: Serial eq '3AA8B7T11'. 
* `permission_resources`:(Array)(ReadOnly) An array of relationships to moBaseMo resources. 
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `moid`:(string) The Moid of the referenced REST resource. 
  + `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the remote type referred by this relationship. 
  + `selector`:(string) An OData $filter expression which describes the REST resource to be referenced. This field maybe set instead of 'moid' by clients.1. If 'moid' is set this field is ignored.1. If 'selector' is set and 'moid' is empty/absent from the request, Intersight determines the Moid of theresource matching the filter expression and populates it in the MoRef that is part of the objectinstance being inserted/updated to fulfill the REST request.An error is returned if the filter matches zero or more than one REST resource.An example filter string is: Serial eq '3AA8B7T11'. 
* `retryable`:(bool) When true, the retry operation can be performed on the workflow. 
* `sequence_key`:(string) This key can be set so that the workflow execution can be sequenced with workflows having the same key. An example usecase is say there are diferent workflows which operate on the server, and are executed at the same time on the same server and the sequence key for all the workflows are same, then workflow engine will enforce that the workflow execution are sequenced and started one after the other, based on timestamp of the arrival of the execution requests. 
* `shared_scope`:(string)(ReadOnly) Intersight provides pre-built workflows, tasks and policies to end users through global catalogs.Objects that are made available through global catalogs are said to have a 'shared' ownership. Shared objects are either made globally available to all end users or restricted to end users based on their license entitlement. Users can use this property to differentiate the scope (global or a specific license tier) to which a shared MO belongs. 
* `tags`:(Array)
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `key`:(string) The string representation of a tag key. 
  + `value`:(string) The string representation of a tag value. 
* `version_context`:(HashMap) -(ReadOnly) The versioning info for this managed object.

If 'moid' is set this field is ignored.1. If 'selector' is set and 'moid' is empty/absent from the request, Intersight determines the Moid of theresource matching the filter expression and populates it in the MoRef that is part of the objectinstance being inserted/updated to fulfill the REST request.An error is returned if the filter matches zero or more than one REST resource.An example filter string is: Serial eq '3AA8B7T11'. 
  + `marked_for_deletion`:(bool)(ReadOnly) The flag to indicate if snapshot is marked for deletion or not. If flag is set then snapshot will be removed after the successful deployment of the policy. 
  + `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type.The value should be the same as the 'ClassId' property. 
  + `ref_mo`:(HashMap) -(ReadOnly) A reference to the original Managed Object.

  + `nr_version`:(string)(ReadOnly) The version of the Managed Object, e.g. an incrementing number or a hash id. 
  + `version_type`:(string)(ReadOnly) Specifies type of version. Currently the only supported value is \ Configured\ that is used to keep track of snapshots of policies and profiles that are intendedto be configured to target endpoints.* `Modified` - Version created every time an object is modified.* `Configured` - Version created every time an object is configured to the service profile.* `Deployed` - Version created for objects related to a service profile when it is deployed. 
* `wait_on_duplicate`:(bool) When true, the workflow will wait for previous one to complete before starting a new one. 
* `workflow_context`:(string) Json formatted string that has the contents of the workflow context used when starting a workflow. 
* `workflow_file`:(HashMap) - Path to workflow metadata file that will be published and started. 
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `contents`:(string) When the type of the download is inline, it will read the file from the contents here. 
  + `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type.The value should be the same as the 'ClassId' property. 
  + `path`:(string) The path of the download from the specified source location for type S3, then this is the object key. 
  + `nr_source`:(string) The source of the download location and if type is S3, then this is the bucket name. In case of MoRef download type the source will have the Moid of the workflow definition. 
  + `type`:(string) The type of download location is captured in type.* `S3` - Download workflow from S3.* `Local` - Download workflow from local path.* `Inline` - Workflow is provided inline.* `MoRef` - Start an existing workflow registered with given Moid. 
* `workflow_info_moid`:(string)(ReadOnly) Returns the workflow info moid of the workflow started by workflow action api. workflowInfoMoid will be an empty sting if an error occurs while starting the workflow.
