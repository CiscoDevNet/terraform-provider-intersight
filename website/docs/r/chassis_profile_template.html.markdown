        The Chassis Profile Template consists of common chassis profile configurations, which can be reused across multiple profiles. Chassis profiles can be created from the template using the Derive operation. Additionally, an existing profile can be attached to a template to use the configuration set in the template.
        To derive chassis profiles from a chassis profile template, you must use the synchronous /v1/bulk/MoCloners bulk API.

Template Updates
When the profile template is updated, a call to the /v1/bulk/MoMergers API is to be made by the client, to synchronize the template changes to all derived profile instances.

## Argument Reference
The following arguments are supported:
* `account_moid`:(string)(ReadOnly) The Account ID for this managed object. 
* `action`:(string) User initiated action. Each profile type has its own supported actions. For HyperFlex cluster profile, the supported actions are -- Validate, Deploy, Continue, Retry, Abort, Unassign For server profile, the support actions are -- Deploy, Unassign. 
* `action_params`:(Array)
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `name`:(string) The action parameter identifier. 
  + `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type.The value should be the same as the 'ClassId' property.

If 'selector' is set and 'moid' is empty/absent from the request, Intersight determines the Moid of theresource matching the filter expression and populates it in the MoRef that is part of the objectinstance being inserted/updated to fulfill the REST request.An error is returned if the filter matches zero or more than one REST resource.An example filter string is: Serial eq '3AA8B7T11'.
