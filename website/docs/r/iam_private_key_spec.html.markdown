# Resource: intersight_iam_private_key_spec
Parameters used to generate a private key.
## Argument Reference
The following arguments are supported:
* `account_moid`:(string)(Computed) The Account ID for this managed object. 
* `algorithm`:(HashMap) - Algorithm used to generate the key pair and algorithm-speicifc parameters, such as RSA modulus size. 
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `additional_properties`:(JSON) - Additional Properties as per object type, can be added as JSON using `jsonencode()`. Allowed Types are: [pkix.EcdsaKeySpec](#pkixEcdsaKeySpec)
[pkix.EddsaKeySpec](#pkixEddsaKeySpec)

  + `name`:(string)(Computed) Name of the key generation algorithm.* `RSA` - Key pairs should be generated by the RSA algorithm. 
  + `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type.The value should be the same as the 'ClassId' property.The enum values provides the list of concrete types that can be instantiated from this abstract type.

This complex property has following sub-properties:

  + `selector`:(string)(Computed) An OData $filter expression which describes the REST resource to be referenced. This field maybe set instead of 'moid' by clients.1. If 'moid' is set this field is ignored.1. If 'selector' is set and 'moid' is empty/absent from the request, Intersight determines the Moid of theresource matching the filter expression and populates it in the MoRef that is part of the objectinstance being inserted/updated to fulfill the REST request.An error is returned if the filter matches zero or more than one REST resource.An example filter string is: Serial eq '3AA8B7T11'.

## Allowed Types in `AdditionalProperties`
 
### [pkix.EcdsaKeySpec](#argument-reference)
The key pair is generated using Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA), as defined in FIPS 186-4.
The ECDSA standard was originally developed for the American National Standards Institute by the Accredited
Standards Committee on Financial Services, X9.
ANS X9.62 defines methods for digital signature generation and verification using ECDSA. Specifications for
the generation of the domain parameters used during the generation and verification of digital signatures
are also included in ANS X9.62.
* `curve`:(string) A specific set of Elliptic Curve parameters, as recommended by NIST in FIPS 186-4.* `P256` - P256 returns a Curve which implements P-256, as defined in FIPS 186-4, section D.2.3.* `P224` - P224 returns a Curve which implements P-224, as defined in FIPS 186-4, section D.2.2.* `P384` - P384 returns a Curve which implements P-384, as defined in FIPS 186-4, section D.2.4.* `P521` - P521 returns a Curve which implements P-521, as defined in FIPS 186-4, section D.2.5. 

### [pkix.EddsaKeySpec](#argument-reference)
The key pair is generated using Edwards-Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (EdDSA).
The Edwards-curve Digital Signature Algorithm (EdDSA) is a variant of
Schnorr's signature system with (possibly twisted) Edwards curves.

### [pkix.RsaAlgorithm](#argument-reference)
The key pair is generated using the RSA algorithm and specified parameters.
* `modulus`:(int) The length of the RSA key, expressed in bits, for both public and private keys.* `2048` - A key length of 2048 bits.* `2560` - A key length of 2560 bits.* `3072` - A key length of 3072 bits.* `3584` - A key length of 3584 bits.* `4096` - A key length of 4096 bits.
