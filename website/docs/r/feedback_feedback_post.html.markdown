        ### Overview
        The FeedbackPost object serves as the initial entry point for user feedback within the system. This provides a mechanism for users to submit their comments and evaluations directly through the user interface.
        #### Purpose
        Feedback Post enables users to capture and submit first-hand feedback directly from the interface, ensuring that original input is accurately preserved and processed. It supports seamless UI integration, immediate submission, and reliable data retention for effective analysis and response
        #### Key Concepts
        - **User-Driven:** - Facilitates direct interaction between users and the feedback system, ensuring that user voices are heard and considered.
        - **Shared Resource:** -Functions as a shared organizational resource, accessible across various departments and privilege sets.

## Argument Reference
The following arguments are supported:
* `account`:(HashMap) -(ReadOnly) A reference to a iamAccount resource.When the $expand query parameter is specified, the referenced resource is returned inline. 
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `moid`:(string) The Moid of the referenced REST resource. 
  + `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the remote type referred by this relationship. 
  + `selector`:(string) An OData $filter expression which describes the REST resource to be referenced. This field maybe set instead of 'moid' by clients.1. If 'moid' is set this field is ignored.1. If 'selector' is set and 'moid' is empty/absent from the request, Intersight determines the Moid of theresource matching the filter expression and populates it in the MoRef that is part of the objectinstance being inserted/updated to fulfill the REST request.An error is returned if the filter matches zero or more than one REST resource.An example filter string is: Serial eq '3AA8B7T11'. 
* `account_moid`:(string)(ReadOnly) The Account ID for this managed object. 
* `ancestors`:(Array)(ReadOnly) An array of relationships to moBaseMo resources.
