# Resource: intersight_hyperflex_health_check_package_checksum
HyperFlex health check Debian Package SHA512 checksum.
## Usage Example
### Resource Creation

```hcl
resource "intersight_hyperflex_health_check_package_checksum" "hyperflex_health_check_package_checksum1" {
  checksum     = "a5dd9d00d84a2e9f2bc5df326fd9b8f1878d79c431b8c7f5032a52b47d993d63"
  name         = "hx-health-monitor"
  package_name = "hx-health-monitor_1.0.0_69_x86_64.deb"
  timestamp    = "2021-01-14T00:14:19Z"
}
```
## Argument Reference
The following arguments are supported:
* `account_moid`:(string)(ReadOnly) The Account ID for this managed object. 
* `ancestors`:(Array)(ReadOnly) An array of relationships to moBaseMo resources. 
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `moid`:(string) The Moid of the referenced REST resource. 
  + `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the remote type referred by this relationship. 
  + `selector`:(string) An OData $filter expression which describes the REST resource to be referenced. This field maybe set instead of 'moid' by clients.1. If 'moid' is set this field is ignored.1. If 'selector' is set and 'moid' is empty/absent from the request, Intersight determines the Moid of theresource matching the filter expression and populates it in the MoRef that is part of the objectinstance being inserted/updated to fulfill the REST request.An error is returned if the filter matches zero or more than one REST resource.An example filter string is: Serial eq '3AA8B7T11'. 
* `checksum`:(string) SHA512 checksum of the health check package. 
* `create_time`:(string)(ReadOnly) The time when this managed object was created. 
* `domain_group_moid`:(string)(ReadOnly) The DomainGroup ID for this managed object. 
* `mod_time`:(string)(ReadOnly) The time when this managed object was last modified. 
* `moid`:(string) The unique identifier of this Managed Object instance. 
* `name`:(string) Name of the health check Debian package. 
* `owners`:
                (Array of schema.TypeString) -(ReadOnly)
* `package_name`:(string) HyperFlex health check Debian package file name. 
* `parent`:(HashMap) -(ReadOnly) A reference to a moBaseMo resource.When the $expand query parameter is specified, the referenced resource is returned inline.

* `shared_scope`:(string)(ReadOnly) Intersight provides pre-built workflows, tasks and policies to end users through global catalogs.Objects that are made available through global catalogs are said to have a 'shared' ownership. Shared objects are either made globally available to all end users or restricted to end users based on their license entitlement. Users can use this property to differentiate the scope (global or a specific license tier) to which a shared MO belongs. 
* `tags`:(Array)
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `key`:(string) The string representation of a tag key. 
  + `value`:(string) The string representation of a tag value. 
* `timestamp`:(string) Timestamp of last update of HyperFlex health check package checksum. 
* `nr_version`:(string) HyperFlex health check Debian Package Version. 
* `version_context`:(HashMap) -(ReadOnly) The versioning info for this managed object.
