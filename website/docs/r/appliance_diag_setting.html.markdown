        DiagSetting model is used for changing the password of the operating system's diagnostic
        user account. The diagnostic user account can be used to login to the Intersight Appliance
        virtual machine.
        The diagnostic user account is protected by two separate authentication mechanisms: user's
        password and Cisco CT-engine generated key. Only the Intersight Appliance's local account
        administrator has the privileges to use this REST API.

# Resource: intersight_appliance_diag_setting
DiagSetting model is used for changing the password of the operating system's diagnostic
user account. The diagnostic user account can be used to login to the Intersight Appliance
virtual machine.
The diagnostic user account is protected by two separate authentication mechanisms: user's
password and Cisco CT-engine generated key. Only the Intersight Appliance's local account
administrator has the privileges to use this REST API.
## Usage Example
### Resource Creation

```hcl
resource "intersight_appliance_diag_setting" "appliance_diag_setting1" {
  password = "ChangeMe"
  account {
    object_type = "iam.Account"
    moid        = var.account
  }
}

variable "account" {
  type        = string
  description = "Moid of iam.Account Mo"
}
```
## Argument Reference
The following arguments are supported:
* `account`:(HashMap) - A reference to a iamAccount resource.When the $expand query parameter is specified, the referenced resource is returned inline. 
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `moid`:(string) The Moid of the referenced REST resource. 
  + `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the remote type referred by this relationship. 
  + `selector`:(string) An OData $filter expression which describes the REST resource to be referenced. This field maybe set instead of 'moid' by clients.1. If 'moid' is set this field is ignored.1. If 'selector' is set and 'moid' is empty/absent from the request, Intersight determines the Moid of theresource matching the filter expression and populates it in the MoRef that is part of the objectinstance being inserted/updated to fulfill the REST request.An error is returned if the filter matches zero or more than one REST resource.An example filter string is: Serial eq '3AA8B7T11'. 
* `account_moid`:(string)(ReadOnly) The Account ID for this managed object. 
* `ancestors`:(Array)(ReadOnly) An array of relationships to moBaseMo resources.

* `shared_scope`:(string)(ReadOnly) Intersight provides pre-built workflows, tasks and policies to end users through global catalogs.Objects that are made available through global catalogs are said to have a 'shared' ownership.
