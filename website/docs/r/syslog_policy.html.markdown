# Resource: intersight_syslog._policy
The syslog policy configure the syslog server to receive CIMC log entries.
## Argument Reference
The following arguments are supported:
* `additional_properties`:
(Array with Maximum of one item) - Add additional properties in json format inside `jsonencode()` for this object.
* `class_id`:(string)(Computed) The concrete type of this complex type. Its value must be the same as the 'objectType' property.The OpenAPI document references this property as a discriminator value. 
* `description`:(string) Description of the policy. 
* `local_clients`:(Array)
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `additional_properties`:
(Array with Maximum of one item) - Add additional properties in json format inside `jsonencode()` for this object.
  + `class_id`:(string)(Computed) The concrete type of this complex type. Its value must be the same as the 'objectType' property.The OpenAPI document references this property as a discriminator value. 
  + `min_severity`:(string) Lowest level of messages to be included in the local log.* `warning` - Use logging level warning for logs classified as warning.* `emergency` - Use logging level emergency for logs classified as emergency.* `alert` - Use logging level alert for logs classified as alert.* `critical` - Use logging level critical for logs classified as critical.* `error` - Use logging level error for logs classified as error.* `notice` - Use logging level notice for logs classified as notice.* `informational` - Use logging level informational for logs classified as informational.* `debug` - Use logging level debug for logs classified as debug. 
  + `object_type`:(string) The concrete type of this complex type.The ObjectType property must be set explicitly by API clients when the type is ambiguous. In all other cases, the ObjectType is optional. The type is ambiguous when a managed object contains an array of nested documents, and the documents in the arrayare heterogeneous, i.e. the array can contain nested documents of different types. 
* `moid`:(string) The unique identifier of this Managed Object instance. 
* `name`:(string) Name of the concrete policy. 
* `object_type`:(string)(Computed) The fully-qualified type of this managed object, i.e. the class name.This property is optional. The ObjectType is implied from the URL path.If specified, the value of objectType must match the class name specified in the URL path. 
* `organization`:(Array with Maximum of one item) - A reference to a organizationOrganization resource.When the $expand query parameter is specified, the referenced resource is returned inline. 
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `additional_properties`:
(Array with Maximum of one item) - Add additional properties in json format inside `jsonencode()` for this object.
  + `class_id`:(string)(Computed) The concrete type of this complex type. Its value must be the same as the 'objectType' property.The OpenAPI document references this property as a discriminator value. 
  + `moid`:(string)(Computed) The Moid of the referenced REST resource. 
  + `object_type`:(string) The concrete type of this complex type.The ObjectType property must be set explicitly by API clients when the type is ambiguous. In all other cases, the ObjectType is optional. The type is ambiguous when a managed object contains an array of nested documents, and the documents in the arrayare heterogeneous, i.e. the array can contain nested documents of different types. 
  + `selector`:(string)(Computed) An OData $filter expression which describes the REST resource to be referenced. This field maybe set instead of 'moid' by clients.1. If 'moid' is set this field is ignored.1. If 'selector' is set and 'moid' is empty/absent from the request, Intersight determines the Moid of theresource matching the filter expression and populates it in the MoRef that is part of the objectinstance being inserted/updated to fulfill the REST request.An error is returned if the filter matches zero or more than one REST resource.An example filter string is: Serial eq '3AA8B7T11'. 
* `profiles`:(Array) An array of relationships to policyAbstractConfigProfile resources.

* `remote_clients`:(Array)
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `additional_properties`:
(Array with Maximum of one item) - Add additional properties in json format inside `jsonencode()` for this object.
  + `class_id`:(string)(Computed) The concrete type of this complex type. Its value must be the same as the 'objectType' property.The OpenAPI document references this property as a discriminator value. 
  + `enabled`:(bool) Enables/disables remote logging for the endpoint If enabled, log messages will be sent to the syslog server mentioned in the Hostname/IP Address field. 
  + `hostname`:(string) Hostname or IP Address of the syslog server where log should be stored. 
  + `min_severity`:(string) Lowest level of messages to be included in the remote log.* `warning` - Use logging level warning for logs classified as warning.* `emergency` - Use logging level emergency for logs classified as emergency.* `alert` - Use logging level alert for logs classified as alert.* `critical` - Use logging level critical for logs classified as critical.* `error` - Use logging level error for logs classified as error.* `notice` - Use logging level notice for logs classified as notice.* `informational` - Use logging level informational for logs classified as informational.* `debug` - Use logging level debug for logs classified as debug.

  + `port`:(int) Port number used for logging on syslog server. 
  + `protocol`:(string) Transport layer protocol for transmission of log messages to syslog server.* `udp` - Use User Datagram Protocol (UDP) for syslog remote server connection.* `tcp` - Use Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) for syslog remote server connection.
