# Resource: intersight_syslog_policy
The syslog policy configure the syslog server to receive CIMC log entries.
## Usage Example
### Resource Creation

```hcl
resource "intersight_syslog_policy" "syslog1" {
  name        = "syslog1"
  description = "demo syslog policy"
  local_clients {
    min_severity = "emergency"
    object_type  = "syslog.LocalFileLoggingClient"
  }
  remote_clients {
    enabled      = true
    hostname     = "10.10.10.10"
    port         = 514
    protocol     = "tcp"
    min_severity = "emergency"
    object_type  = "syslog.RemoteLoggingClient"
  }
  remote_clients {
    enabled      = true
    hostname     = "2001:0db8:0a0b:12f0:0000:0000:0000:0004"
    port         = 64000
    protocol     = "udp"
    min_severity = "emergency"
    object_type  = "syslog.RemoteLoggingClient"
  }
  profiles {
    moid        = var.profile
    object_type = "server.Profile"
  }
  organization {
    object_type = "organization.Organization"
    moid        = var.organization
  }
}

variable "organization" {
   type = string
   description = "<value for organization>"
 }

 variable "profile"{
   type = string
   description = "Moid of server.Profile"

## Argument Reference
The following arguments are supported:
* `account_moid`:(string)(ReadOnly) The Account ID for this managed object. 
* `ancestors`:(Array)(ReadOnly) An array of relationships to moBaseMo resources. 
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `moid`:(string) The Moid of the referenced REST resource. 
  + `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the remote type referred by this relationship. 
  + `selector`:(string) An OData $filter expression which describes the REST resource to be referenced. This field maybe set instead of 'moid' by clients.1. If 'moid' is set this field is ignored.1.
