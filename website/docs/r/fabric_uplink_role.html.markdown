# Resource: intersight_fabric_uplink_role
Configuration object sent by user to create a uplink port.
## Usage Example
### Resource Creation

```hcl
resource "intersight_fabric_uplink_role" "fabric_uplink_role1" {
  aggregate_port_id = 0
  port_id           = 1
  slot_id           = 4
  admin_speed       = "Auto"
  fec               = "Auto"
  port_policy {
    moid        = intersight_fabric_port_policy.fabric_port_policy1.moid
    object_type = "fabric.PortPolicy"
  }
}
```

## Argument Reference
The following arguments are supported:
* `account_moid`:(string)(ReadOnly) The Account ID for this managed object. 
* `admin_speed`:(string) Admin configured speed for the port.* `Auto` - Admin configurable speed AUTO ( default ).* `1Gbps` - Admin configurable speed 1Gbps.* `10Gbps` - Admin configurable speed 10Gbps.* `25Gbps` - Admin configurable speed 25Gbps.* `40Gbps` - Admin configurable speed 40Gbps.* `50Gbps` - Admin configurable speed 50Gbps.* `100Gbps` - Admin configurable speed 100Gbps.* `400Gbps` - Admin configurable speed 400Gbps.* `NegAuto25Gbps` - Admin configurable 25Gbps auto negotiation for ports and port-channels.Speed is applicable on Ethernet Uplink, Ethernet Appliance and FCoE Uplink port and port-channel roles.This speed config is only applicable to non-breakout ports on UCS-FI-6454 and UCS-FI-64108. 
* `aggregate_port_id`:(int) Breakout port Identifier of the Switch Interface.When a port is not configured as a breakout port, the aggregatePortId is set to 0, and unused.When a port is configured as a breakout port, the 'aggregatePortId' port number as labeled on the equipment,e.g. the id of the port on the switch. 
* `ancestors`:(Array)(ReadOnly) An array of relationships to moBaseMo resources. 
This complex property has following sub-properties:
