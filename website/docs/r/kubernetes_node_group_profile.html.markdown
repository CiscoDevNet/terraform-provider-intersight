# Resource: intersight_kubernetes_node_group_profile
A configuration profile for a node group in a Kubernetes cluster.
## Usage Example
### Resource Creation

```hcl
resource "intersight_kubernetes_node_group_profile" "kubernetes_node_group_profile1" {
  description = "kubernetes node group profile"
  name        = "kubernetes_node_group_profile1"
  type        = "instance"
  action      = "Deploy"
  config_context {
    control_action = "Deploy"
    error_state    = "Pre-config-error"
  }
  node_type = "Worker"
}
```
## Argument Reference
The following arguments are supported:
* `account_moid`:(string)(ReadOnly) The Account ID for this managed object. 
* `action`:(string) User initiated action. Each profile type has its own supported actions. For HyperFlex cluster profile, the supported actions are -- Validate, Deploy, Continue, Retry, Abort, Unassign For server profile, the support actions are -- Deploy, Unassign. 
* `action_params`:(Array)
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `name`:(string) The action parameter identifier. 
  + `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type.The value should be the same as the 'ClassId' property. 
  + `value`:(string) The action parameter value.

This complex property has following sub-properties:

  + `selector`:(string) An OData $filter expression which describes the REST resource to be referenced. This field maybe set instead of 'moid' by clients.1. If 'moid' is set this field is ignored.1. If 'selector' is set and 'moid' is empty/absent from the request, Intersight determines the Moid of theresource matching the filter expression and populates it in the MoRef that is part of the objectinstance being inserted/updated to fulfill the REST request.An error is returned if the filter matches zero or more than one REST resource.An example filter string is: Serial eq '3AA8B7T11'.
