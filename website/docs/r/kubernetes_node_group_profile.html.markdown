# Resource: intersight_kubernetes_node_group_profile
A configuration profile for a node group in a Kubernetes cluster.
## Usage Example
### Resource Creation

```hcl
resource "intersight_kubernetes_node_group_profile" "kubernetes_node_group_profile1" {
  description = "kubernetes node group profile"
  name        = "kubernetes_node_group_profile1"
  type        = "instance"
  action      = "Deploy"
  config_context {
    control_action = "Deploy"
    error_state    = "Pre-config-error"
    object_type    = "policy.ConfigContext"
  }
  node_type = "Worker"
  cluster_profile {
    moid        = var.kubernetes_cluster_profile
    object_type = "kubernetes.ClusterProfile"
  }
}

```
## Argument Reference
The following arguments are supported:

* `action`:(string) User initiated action. Each profile type has its own supported actions. For HyperFlex cluster profile, the supported actions are -- Validate, Deploy, Continue, Retry, Abort, Unassign For server profile, the support actions are -- Deploy, Unassign. 
* `action_params`:(Array)
This complex property has following sub-properties:
