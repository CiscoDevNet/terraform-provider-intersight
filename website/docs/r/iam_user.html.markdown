# Resource: intersight_iam_user
The Intersight account user.
## Usage Example
### Resource Creation

```hcl
resource "intersight_iam_user" "iam_user1" {
  email = "email@example.com"
  idpreference {
    moid        = var.iam_idp_reference
    object_type = "iam.IdpReference"
  }
  parent {
    moid        = var.iam_idp_reference
    object_type = "iam.IdpReference"
  }
  permissions {
    moid        = var.iam_idp_reference
    object_type = "iam.Permission"
  }
  user_id_or_email = "email@example.com"
}

## Argument Reference
The following arguments are supported:

* `ancestors`:(Array)(ReadOnly) An array of relationships to moBaseMo resources. 
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `moid`:(string) The Moid of the referenced REST resource. 
  + `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the remote type referred by this relationship. 
  + `selector`:(string) An OData $filter expression which describes the REST resource to be referenced. This field maybe set instead of 'moid' by clients.1. If 'moid' is set this field is ignored.1.
