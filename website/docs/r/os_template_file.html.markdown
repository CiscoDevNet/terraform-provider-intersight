# Resource: intersight_os_template_file
A TemplateFile is an OS specific answer file that helps with the unattended installation.
The file can also be a template file with placeholders instead of actual answers.
Intersight supports the golang template syntax specified in https://golang.org/pkg/text/template/.
The values for these placeholders shall be given during OS installation in the form of 'additionalProperties'
in os.OsInstall object.
## Argument Reference
The following arguments are supported:
* `account_moid`:(string)(ReadOnly) The Account ID for this managed object. 
* `ancestors`:(Array)(ReadOnly) An array of relationships to moBaseMo resources. 
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `moid`:(string) The Moid of the referenced REST resource. 
  + `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the remote type referred by this relationship. 
  + `selector`:(string) An OData $filter expression which describes the REST resource to be referenced. This field maybe set instead of 'moid' by clients.1. If 'moid' is set this field is ignored.1. If 'selector' is set and 'moid' is empty/absent from the request, Intersight determines the Moid of theresource matching the filter expression and populates it in the MoRef that is part of the objectinstance being inserted/updated to fulfill the REST request.An error is returned if the filter matches zero or more than one REST resource.An example filter string is: Serial eq '3AA8B7T11'. 
* `create_time`:(string)(ReadOnly) The time when this managed object was created. 
* `domain_group_moid`:(string)(ReadOnly) The DomainGroup ID for this managed object. 
* `mod_time`:(string)(ReadOnly) The time when this managed object was last modified. 
* `moid`:(string) The unique identifier of this Managed Object instance. 
* `name`:(string) The name of the OS Template File that user uploads for unattended installation. 
* `owners`:
                (Array of schema.TypeString) -(ReadOnly)
* `parent`:(HashMap) -(ReadOnly) A reference to a moBaseMo resource.When the $expand query parameter is specified, the referenced resource is returned inline. 
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `moid`:(string) The Moid of the referenced REST resource. 
  + `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the remote type referred by this relationship. 
  + `selector`:(string) An OData $filter expression which describes the REST resource to be referenced. This field maybe set instead of 'moid' by clients.1. If 'moid' is set this field is ignored.1. If 'selector' is set and 'moid' is empty/absent from the request, Intersight determines the Moid of theresource matching the filter expression and populates it in the MoRef that is part of the objectinstance being inserted/updated to fulfill the REST request.An error is returned if the filter matches zero or more than one REST resource.An example filter string is: Serial eq '3AA8B7T11'. 
* `permission_resources`:(Array)(ReadOnly) An array of relationships to moBaseMo resources. 
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `moid`:(string) The Moid of the referenced REST resource. 
  + `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the remote type referred by this relationship. 
  + `selector`:(string) An OData $filter expression which describes the REST resource to be referenced. This field maybe set instead of 'moid' by clients.1. If 'moid' is set this field is ignored.1.

* `placeholders`:
                (Array of schema.TypeString) -
* `shared_scope`:(string)(ReadOnly) Intersight provides pre-built workflows, tasks and policies to end users through global catalogs.Objects that are made available through global catalogs are said to have a 'shared' ownership. Shared objects are either made globally available to all end users or restricted to end users based on their license entitlement. Users can use this property to differentiate the scope (global or a specific license tier) to which a shared MO belongs. 
* `tags`:(Array)
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `key`:(string) The string representation of a tag key. 
  + `value`:(string) The string representation of a tag value. 
* `template_content`:(string) The content of the entire template file is stored as value. The contentcan either be a static file content or a template content.The template is expected to conform to the golang template syntax. The placeholders, if any, would be populated and the values provided would be used to populate this template. 
* `version_context`:(HashMap) -(ReadOnly) The versioning info for this managed object. 
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `interested_mos`:(Array)
This complex property has following sub-properties:
    + `moid`:(string) The Moid of the referenced REST resource. 
    + `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the remote type referred by this relationship. 
    + `selector`:(string) An OData $filter expression which describes the REST resource to be referenced. This field maybe set instead of 'moid' by clients.1. If 'moid' is set this field is ignored.1. If 'selector' is set and 'moid' is empty/absent from the request, Intersight determines the Moid of theresource matching the filter expression and populates it in the MoRef that is part of the objectinstance being inserted/updated to fulfill the REST request.An error is returned if the filter matches zero or more than one REST resource.An example filter string is: Serial eq '3AA8B7T11'. 
  + `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type.The value should be the same as the 'ClassId' property. 
  + `ref_mo`:(HashMap) -(ReadOnly) A reference to the original Managed Object. 
This complex property has following sub-properties:
    + `moid`:(string) The Moid of the referenced REST resource.

  + `timestamp`:(string)(ReadOnly) The time this versioned Managed Object was created. 
  + `nr_version`:(string)(ReadOnly) The version of the Managed Object, e.g. an incrementing number or a hash id. 
  + `version_type`:(string)(ReadOnly) Specifies type of version. Currently the only supported value is \ Configured\ that is used to keep track of snapshots of policies and profiles that are intendedto be configured to target endpoints.* `Modified` - Version created every time an object is modified.* `Configured` - Version created every time an object is configured to the service profile.* `Deployed` - Version created for objects related to a service profile when it is deployed.
