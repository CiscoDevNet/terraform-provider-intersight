* `template_sync_status`:(string)(ReadOnly) The sync status of the current MO wrt the attached Template MO.* `None` - The Enum value represents that the object is not attached to any template.* `OK` - The Enum value represents that the object values are in sync with attached template.* `Scheduled` - The Enum value represents that the object sync from attached template is scheduled from template.* `InProgress` - The Enum value represents that the object sync with the attached template is in progress.* `OutOfSync` - The Enum value represents that the object values are not in sync with attached template. 
* `usnic_settings`:(HashMap) - User Space NIC Settings that enable low-latency and higher throughput by bypassing the kernel layer when sending/receiving packets. 
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `cos`:(int) Class of Service to be used for traffic on the usNIC. 
  + `nr_count`:(int) Number of usNIC interfaces to be created. When usNIC is enabled, the valid values are from 1 to 225. When usNIC is disabled, the default value is 0. 
  + `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type.The value should be the same as the 'ClassId' property. 
  + `usnic_adapter_policy`:(string) Ethernet Adapter policy to be associated with the usNICs. 
* `version_context`:(HashMap) -(ReadOnly) The versioning info for this managed object. 
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `interested_mos`:(Array)
This complex property has following sub-properties:
    + `moid`:(string) The Moid of the referenced REST resource. 
    + `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the remote type referred by this relationship. 
    + `selector`:(string) An OData $filter expression which describes the REST resource to be referenced. This field maybe set instead of 'moid' by clients.1. If 'moid' is set this field is ignored.1. If 'selector' is set and 'moid' is empty/absent from the request, Intersight determines the Moid of theresource matching the filter expression and populates it in the MoRef that is part of the objectinstance being inserted/updated to fulfill the REST request.An error is returned if the filter matches zero or more than one REST resource.An example filter string is: Serial eq '3AA8B7T11'. 
  + `marked_for_deletion`:(bool)(ReadOnly) The flag to indicate if snapshot is marked for deletion or not. If flag is set then snapshot will be removed after the successful deployment of the policy. 
  + `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type.The value should be the same as the 'ClassId' property. 
  + `ref_mo`:(HashMap) -(ReadOnly) A reference to the original Managed Object. 
This complex property has following sub-properties:
    + `moid`:(string) The Moid of the referenced REST resource. 
    + `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the remote type referred by this relationship.

  + `timestamp`:(string)(ReadOnly) The time this versioned Managed Object was created. 
  + `nr_version`:(string)(ReadOnly) The version of the Managed Object, e.g. an incrementing number or a hash id. 
  + `version_type`:(string)(ReadOnly) Specifies type of version. Currently the only supported value is \ Configured\ that is used to keep track of snapshots of policies and profiles that are intendedto be configured to target endpoints.* `Modified` - Version created every time an object is modified.* `Configured` - Version created every time an object is configured to the service profile.* `Deployed` - Version created for objects related to a service profile when it is deployed. 
* `vif_id`:(int)(ReadOnly) The Vif Id should be same as the channel number of the vethernet created on switch in order to set up the data path. The property is applicable only for FI attached servers where a vethernet is created on the switch for every vNIC. 
* `vmq_settings`:(HashMap) - Virtual Machine Queue Settings for the virtual interface that allow efficient transfer of network traffic to the guest OS. 
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `enabled`:(bool) Enables VMQ feature on the virtual interface. 
  + `multi_queue_support`:(bool) Enables Virtual Machine Multi-Queue feature on the virtual interface. VMMQ allows configuration of multiple I/O queues for a single VM and thus distributes traffic across multiple CPU cores in a VM. 
  + `num_interrupts`:(int) The number of interrupt resources to be allocated. Recommended value is the number of CPU threads or logical processors available in the server. 
  + `num_sub_vnics`:(int) The number of sub vNICs to be created. 
  + `num_vmqs`:(int) The number of hardware Virtual Machine Queues to be allocated. The number of VMQs per adapter must be one more than the maximum number of VM NICs. 
  + `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type.The value should be the same as the 'ClassId' property. 
  + `vmmq_adapter_policy`:(string) Ethernet Adapter policy to be associated with the Sub vNICs. The Transmit Queue and Receive Queue resource value of VMMQ adapter policy should be greater than or equal to the configured number of sub vNICs.
