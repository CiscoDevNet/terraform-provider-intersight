# Resource: intersight_hyperflex_local_credential_policy
A policy specifying credentials for HyperFlex cluster such as controller VM password, hypervisor username, and password.
## Usage Example
### Resource Creation

```hcl
resource "intersight_hyperflex_local_credential_policy" "hyperflex_local_credential_policy1" {
  hxdp_root_pwd               = "ChangeMe@123"
  hypervisor_admin            = "admin"
  hypervisor_admin_pwd        = "ChangeMe"
  factory_hypervisor_password = false
  organization {
    object_type = "organization.Organization"
    moid        = var.organization
  }
  name = "hyperflex_local_credential_policy1"
}
```
## Argument Reference
The following arguments are supported:
* `account_moid`:(string)(ReadOnly) The Account ID for this managed object. 
* `ancestors`:(Array)(ReadOnly) An array of relationships to moBaseMo resources. 
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `moid`:(string) The Moid of the referenced REST resource. 
  + `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the remote type referred by this relationship. 
  + `selector`:(string) An OData $filter expression which describes the REST resource to be referenced. This field maybe set instead of 'moid' by clients.1. If 'moid' is set this field is ignored.1. If 'selector' is set and 'moid' is empty/absent from the request, Intersight determines the Moid of theresource matching the filter expression and populates it in the MoRef that is part of the objectinstance being inserted/updated to fulfill the REST request.An error is returned if the filter matches zero or more than one REST resource.An example filter string is: Serial eq '3AA8B7T11'. 
* `cluster_profiles`:(Array) An array of relationships to hyperflexClusterProfile resources. 
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `moid`:(string) The Moid of the referenced REST resource. 
  + `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the remote type referred by this relationship. 
  + `selector`:(string) An OData $filter expression which describes the REST resource to be referenced. This field maybe set instead of 'moid' by clients.1. If 'moid' is set this field is ignored.1. If 'selector' is set and 'moid' is empty/absent from the request, Intersight determines the Moid of theresource matching the filter expression and populates it in the MoRef that is part of the objectinstance being inserted/updated to fulfill the REST request.An error is returned if the filter matches zero or more than one REST resource.An example filter string is: Serial eq '3AA8B7T11'. 
* `create_time`:(string)(ReadOnly) The time when this managed object was created. 
* `description`:(string) Description of the policy. 
* `domain_group_moid`:(string)(ReadOnly) The DomainGroup ID for this managed object. 
* `factory_hypervisor_password`:(bool) Indicates if Hypervisor password is the factory set default password. For HyperFlex Data Platform versions 3.0 or higher, enable this if the default password was not changed on the Hypervisor. It is required to supply a new custom Hypervisor password that will be applied to the Hypervisor during deployment. For HyperFlex Data Platform versions prior to 3.0 release, this setting has no effect and the default password will be used for initial install. The Hypervisor password should be changed after deployment. 
* `hxdp_root_pwd`:(string) HyperFlex storage controller VM password must contain a minimum of 10 characters, with at least 1 lowercase, 1 uppercase, 1 numeric, and 1 of these -._@#$%^&*! special characters. 
* `hypervisor_admin`:(string) Hypervisor administrator username must contain only alphanumeric characters. 
* `hypervisor_admin_pwd`:(string) The Hypervisor root password. For HyperFlex Data Platform 3.0 or later, if the factory default password was not manually changed, you must set a new custom password. If the password was manually changed, you must not enable the factory default password property and provide the current hypervisor password. Note - All HyperFlex nodes require the same hypervisor password for installation. For HyperFlex Data Platform prior to 3.0, use the default password \ Cisco123\  for newly manufactured HyperFlex servers. A custom password should only be entered if hypervisor credentials were manually changed prior to deployment. 
* `is_deployment_private_key_set`:(bool)(ReadOnly) Indicates whether the value of the 'deploymentPrivateKey' property has been set. 
* `is_hxdp_root_pwd_set`:(bool)(ReadOnly) Indicates whether the value of the 'hxdpRootPwd' property has been set. 
* `is_hypervisor_admin_pwd_set`:(bool)(ReadOnly) Indicates whether the value of the 'hypervisorAdminPwd' property has been set. 
* `mod_time`:(string)(ReadOnly) The time when this managed object was last modified. 
* `moid`:(string) The unique identifier of this Managed Object instance. 
* `name`:(string) Name of the concrete policy. 
* `organization`:(HashMap) - A reference to a organizationOrganization resource.When the $expand query parameter is specified, the referenced resource is returned inline.
