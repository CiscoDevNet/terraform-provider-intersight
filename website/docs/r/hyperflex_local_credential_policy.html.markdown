# Resource: intersight_hyperflex._local_credential_policy
A policy specifying credentials for HyperFlex cluster such as controller VM password, hypervisor username, and password.
## Argument Reference
The following arguments are supported:
* `additional_properties`:
(Array with Maximum of one item) - Add additional properties in json format inside `jsonencode()` for this object.
* `class_id`:(string)(Computed) The concrete type of this complex type. Its value must be the same as the 'objectType' property.The OpenAPI document references this property as a discriminator value. 
* `cluster_profiles`:(Array) An array of relationships to hyperflexClusterProfile resources. 
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `additional_properties`:
(Array with Maximum of one item) - Add additional properties in json format inside `jsonencode()` for this object.
  + `class_id`:(string)(Computed) The concrete type of this complex type. Its value must be the same as the 'objectType' property.The OpenAPI document references this property as a discriminator value. 
  + `moid`:(string)(Computed) The Moid of the referenced REST resource. 
  + `object_type`:(string) The concrete type of this complex type.The ObjectType property must be set explicitly by API clients when the type is ambiguous. In all other cases, the ObjectType is optional. The type is ambiguous when a managed object contains an array of nested documents, and the documents in the arrayare heterogeneous, i.e. the array can contain nested documents of different types. 
  + `selector`:(string)(Computed) An OData $filter expression which describes the REST resource to be referenced. This field maybe set instead of 'moid' by clients.1. If 'moid' is set this field is ignored.1. If 'selector' is set and 'moid' is empty/absent from the request, Intersight determines the Moid of theresource matching the filter expression and populates it in the MoRef that is part of the objectinstance being inserted/updated to fulfill the REST request.An error is returned if the filter matches zero or more than one REST resource.An example filter string is: Serial eq '3AA8B7T11'. 
* `description`:(string) Description of the policy. 
* `factory_hypervisor_password`:(bool) Indicates if Hypervisor password is the factory set default password. For HyperFlex Data Platform versions 3.0 or higher, enable this if the default password was not changed on the Hypervisor. It is required to supply a new custom Hypervisor password that will be applied to the Hypervisor during deployment. For HyperFlex Data Platform versions prior to 3.0 release, this setting has no effect and the default password will be used for initial install. The Hypervisor password should be changed after deployment. 
* `hxdp_root_pwd`:(string) HyperFlex storage controller VM password must contain a minimum of 10 characters, with at least 1 lowercase, 1 uppercase, 1 numeric, and 1 of these -_@#$%^&*! special characters. 
* `hypervisor_admin`:(string) Hypervisor administrator username must contain only alphanumeric characters. Use the root account for ESXi deployments. 
* `hypervisor_admin_pwd`:(string) The ESXi root password. For HyperFlex Data Platform 3.0 or later, if the factory default password was not manually changed, you must set a new custom password. If the password was manually changed, you must not enable the factory default password property and provide the current hypervisor password. Note - All HyperFlex nodes require the same hypervisor password for installation. For HyperFlex Data Platform prior to 3.0, use the default password \ Cisco123\  for newly manufactured HyperFlex servers. A custom password should only be entered if hypervisor credentials were manually changed prior to deployment. 
* `is_hxdp_root_pwd_set`:(bool)(Computed) Indicates whether the value of the 'hxdpRootPwd' property has been set. 
* `is_hypervisor_admin_pwd_set`:(bool)(Computed) Indicates whether the value of the 'hypervisorAdminPwd' property has been set. 
* `moid`:(string) The unique identifier of this Managed Object instance. 
* `name`:(string) Name of the concrete policy. 
* `object_type`:(string)(Computed) The fully-qualified type of this managed object, i.e. the class name.This property is optional. The ObjectType is implied from the URL path.If specified, the value of objectType must match the class name specified in the URL path. 
* `organization`:(Array with Maximum of one item) - A reference to a organizationOrganization resource.When the $expand query parameter is specified, the referenced resource is returned inline. 
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `additional_properties`:
(Array with Maximum of one item) - Add additional properties in json format inside `jsonencode()` for this object.
  + `class_id`:(string)(Computed) The concrete type of this complex type. Its value must be the same as the 'objectType' property.The OpenAPI document references this property as a discriminator value. 
  + `moid`:(string)(Computed) The Moid of the referenced REST resource. 
  + `object_type`:(string) The concrete type of this complex type.The ObjectType property must be set explicitly by API clients when the type is ambiguous. In all other cases, the ObjectType is optional. The type is ambiguous when a managed object contains an array of nested documents, and the documents in the arrayare heterogeneous, i.e. the array can contain nested documents of different types. 
  + `selector`:(string)(Computed) An OData $filter expression which describes the REST resource to be referenced. This field maybe set instead of 'moid' by clients.1. If 'moid' is set this field is ignored.1. If 'selector' is set and 'moid' is empty/absent from the request, Intersight determines the Moid of theresource matching the filter expression and populates it in the MoRef that is part of the objectinstance being inserted/updated to fulfill the REST request.An error is returned if the filter matches zero or more than one REST resource.An example filter string is: Serial eq '3AA8B7T11'. 
* `tags`:(Array)
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `additional_properties`:
(Array with Maximum of one item) - Add additional properties in json format inside `jsonencode()` for this object.
  + `key`:(string) The string representation of a tag key. 
  + `value`:(string) The string representation of a tag value.
