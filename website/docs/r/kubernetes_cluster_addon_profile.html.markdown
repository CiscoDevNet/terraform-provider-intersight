# Resource: intersight_kubernetes_cluster_addon_profile
A profile that describes a collection of Addons for a particular cluster.
## Usage Example
### Resource Creation

```hcl
resource "intersight_kubernetes_cluster_addon_profile" "iks1" {
  name = "cluster_addon_profile1"

  addons {
    addon_policy {
      moid        = intersight_kubernetes_addon_policy.kubernetes_addon_policy1.moid
      object_type ="kubernetes.Addon"
    }
  }
  addons {
    addon_policy {
      moid        = intersight_kubernetes_addon_policy.kubernetes_addon_policy1.moid
      object_type = "kubernetes.Addon"
    }
  }
  organization {
    moid        = var.organization
    object_type = "organization.Organization"
  }
}
```

## Argument Reference
The following arguments are supported:

* `addons`:(Array)
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `addon_configuration`:(HashMap) - Addon configuration settings that are specific to a single cluster. 
This complex property has following sub-properties:
    + `install_strategy`:(string) Addon install strategy to determine whether an addon is installed if not present.* `None` - Unspecified install strategy.* `NoAction` - No install action performed.* `InstallOnly` - Only install in green field. No action in case of failure or removal.* `Always` - Attempt install if chart is not already installed. 
    + `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type.The value should be the same as the 'ClassId' property.
