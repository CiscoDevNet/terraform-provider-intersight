# Resource: intersight_workflow_ansible_batch_executor
Intersight allows generic tasks to be created by taking the executor request
body and a response parser specification in the form of content.Grammar object.
Ansible Batch associates the list of Ansible commands executed as SSH requests as part of single
task execution. Each SSH request takes the Ansible command to execute and a response parser
specification based off text to extract fields of interest.
