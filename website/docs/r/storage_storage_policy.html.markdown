# Resource: intersight_storage_storage_policy
The storage policy models the reusable storage related configuration that can be applied on many servers. This policy allows creation of RAID groups using existing disk group policies and virtual drives on the drive groups. The user has options to move all unused disks to JBOD or Unconfigured good state. The security of drives can be enabled through this policy using remote keys from a KMIP server or Manually configured keys.
## Usage Example
### Resource Creation

```hcl
resource "intersight_storage_storage_policy" "tf_storage_policy" {
  name                     = "tf_storage_policy"
  use_jbod_for_vd_creation = true
  description              = "storage policy test"
  unused_disks_state       = "UnconfiguredGood"
  organization {
    object_type = "organization.Organization"
    moid        = var.organization
  }
  global_hot_spares = "3"
  m2_virtual_drive {
    enable      = false
    object_type = "storage.M2VirtualDriveConfig"
  }
}

variable "organization" {
   type = string
   description = "<value for organization>"
 }
```
## Argument Reference
The following arguments are supported:

  + `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the remote type referred by this relationship. 
  + `selector`:(string) An OData $filter expression which describes the REST resource to be referenced. This field maybe set instead of 'moid' by clients.1. If 'moid' is set this field is ignored.1. If 'selector' is set and 'moid' is empty/absent from the request, Intersight determines the Moid of theresource matching the filter expression and populates it in the MoRef that is part of the objectinstance being inserted/updated to fulfill the REST request.An error is returned if the filter matches zero or more than one REST resource.An example filter string is: Serial eq '3AA8B7T11'.
