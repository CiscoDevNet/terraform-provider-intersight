# Resource: intersight_storage_storage_policy
The storage policy models the reusable storage related configuration that can be applied on many servers. This policy allows creation of RAID groups using existing disk group policies and virtual drives on the drive groups. The user has options to move all unused disks to JBOD or Unconfigured good state. The encryption of drives can be enabled through this policy using remote keys from a KMIP server.
## Usage Example
### Resource Creation

```hcl
resource "intersight_storage_storage_policy" "storage_storage1" {
  name                         = "storage_storage_policy1"
  description                  = "storage policy test"
  retain_policy_virtual_drives = true
  unused_disks_state           = "UnconfiguredGood"
  virtual_drives {
    object_type         = "storage.VirtualDriveConfig"
    boot_drive          = true
    drive_cache         = "NoChange"
    expand_to_available = false
    io_policy           = "Direct"
    name                = "RAID0_1"
    access_policy       = "ReadWrite"
    disk_group_policy   = intersight_storage_disk_group_policy.storage_disk_group1.id
    read_policy         = "NoReadAhead"
    size                = 285148
    write_policy        = "WriteThrough"
  }
  organization {
    object_type = "organization.Organization"
    moid        = var.organization
  }
}
```
