  + `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the remote type referred by this relationship. 
  + `selector`:(string) An OData $filter expression which describes the REST resource to be referenced. This field maybe set instead of 'moid' by clients.1. If 'moid' is set this field is ignored.1. If 'selector' is set and 'moid' is empty/absent from the request, Intersight determines the Moid of theresource matching the filter expression and populates it in the MoRef that is part of the objectinstance being inserted/updated to fulfill the REST request.An error is returned if the filter matches zero or more than one REST resource.An example filter string is: Serial eq '3AA8B7T11'. 
* `account_moid`:(string)(ReadOnly) The Account ID for this managed object. 
* `action`:(string) The action of the workflow such as start, cancel, retry, pause.* `None` - No action is set, this is the default value for action field.* `Create` - Create a new instance of the workflow but it does not start the execution of the workflow. Use the Start action to start execution of the workflow.* `Start` - Start a new execution of the workflow.* `Pause` - Pause the workflow, this can only be issued on workflows that are in running state. A workflow can be paused for a maximum of 180 days, after 180 days the workflow will be terminated by the system.* `Resume` - Resume the workflow which was previously paused through pause action on the workflow.* `Rerun` - Rerun the workflow that has previously reached a failed state. The workflow is run from the beginning using inputs from previous execution. Completed and currently running workflows cannot be rerun.

Retry the workflow that has previously reached a final state and has the retryable property set to true. A running or waiting workflow cannot be retried. If the property retryFromTaskName is also passed along with this action, the workflow will be started from that specific task, otherwise the workflow will be restarted from the first task.  The task name in retryFromTaskName must be one of the tasks that completed or failed in the previous run. It is not possible to retry a workflow from a task which wasn't run in the previous iteration.* `RetryFailed` - Retry the workflow that has failed. A running or waiting workflow or a workflow that completed successfully cannot be retried. Only the tasks that failed in the previous run will be retried and the rest of workflow will be run. This action does not restart the workflow and also does not support retrying from a specific task.* `RetryFromTask` - Retry the workflow that has previously reached a failed state and has the retryable property set to true. A running or waiting workflow cannot be retried. RetryFromTaskName must be passed along with this action, and the workflow will be started from that specific task.

  + `workflow_subtype`:(string)(ReadOnly) The subtype of the dynamic workflow. For example - Intersight services offer the following subtypes [Validate, Deploy, Import] for dynamic workflow of type serverconfig. This field is not applicable for user created workflows. 
  + `workflow_type`:(string)(ReadOnly) Intersight services set the type of dynamic workflow that need to be built and executed. This field is not applicable for user created workflows. WorkflowType set as ServerConfig states that a dynamic workflow is executing tasks related to server configuration. 
* `workflow_definition`:(HashMap) - A reference to a workflowWorkflowDefinition resource.When the $expand query parameter is specified, the referenced resource is returned inline. 
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `moid`:(string) The Moid of the referenced REST resource. 
  + `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the remote type referred by this relationship. 
  + `selector`:(string) An OData $filter expression which describes the REST resource to be referenced. This field maybe set instead of 'moid' by clients.1. If 'moid' is set this field is ignored.1. If 'selector' is set and 'moid' is empty/absent from the request, Intersight determines the Moid of theresource matching the filter expression and populates it in the MoRef that is part of the objectinstance being inserted/updated to fulfill the REST request.An error is returned if the filter matches zero or more than one REST resource.An example filter string is: Serial eq '3AA8B7T11'. 
* `workflow_status`:(string)(ReadOnly) The current state of the workflow execution instance. A draft workflow execution will be in NotStarted state and when \ Start\  action is issued then the workflow will move into Waiting state until the first task of the workflow is scheduled at which time it will move into InProgress state. When execution reaches a final state it move to either Completed, Failed or Terminated state. For more details look at the description for each state.* `NotStarted` - Initially all the workflow instances are at \ NotStarted\  state. A workflow can be drafted in this state by issuing Create action. When a workflow is in this state the inputs can be updated until the workflow is started.* `InProgress` - A workflow execution moves into \ InProgress\  state when the first task of the workflow is scheduled for execution and continues to remain in that state as long as there are tasks executing or yet to be scheduled for execution.* `Waiting` - Workflow can go to waiting state due to execution of wait task present in the workflow or the workflow has not started yet either due to duplicate workflow is running or due to workflow throttling. Once Workflow engine picks up the workflow for execution, it will move to in progress state.* `Completed` - A workflow execution moves into Completed state when the execution path of the workflow has reached the Success node in the workflow design and there are no more tasks to be executed. Completed is the final state for the workflow execution instance and no further actions are allowed on this workflow instance.* `Failed` - A workflow execution moves into a Failed state when the execution path of the workflow has reached the Failed node in the workflow design and there are no more tasks to be scheduled. A Failed node can be reached when the last executed task has failed or timed out and there are no further retries available for the task. Also as per the workflow design, the last executed task did not specify an OnFailure task to be executed and hence by default, the execution will reach the Failed node. Actions like \ Rerun\ , \ RetryFailed\  and \ RetryFromTask\  can be issued on failed workflow instances. Please refer to the \ Action\  description for more details.* `Terminated` - A workflow execution moves to Terminated state when user issues a \ Cancel\  action or due to internal errors caused during workflow execution. e.g. - Task input transformation has failed. Terminated is a final state of the workflow, no further action are allowed on this workflow instance.* `Canceled` - A workflow execution moves to Canceled state when a user issues a \ Cancel\  action. Cancel is not a final state, the workflow engine will issue cancel to all the running tasks and then move the workflow to the \ Terminated\  state.* `Paused` - A workflow execution moves to Paused state when user issues a \ Pause\  action. When in paused state the current running task will complete its execution but no further tasks will be scheduled until the workflow is resumed. A paused workflow is resumed when the user issues a \ Resume\  action. Paused workflows can be canceled by user.
