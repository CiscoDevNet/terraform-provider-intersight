# Resource: intersight_iam_app_registration
AppRegistration encapsulates the meta-data values of a registered OAuth2 client application, as described in
https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7591#section-2.
Registered client applications have a set of metadata values associated with their client identifier
at the Intersight authorization server, including the list of valid redirection URIs or a display name.
The meta-data is used to specify how a client application can retrieve a OAuth2 Access Token and subsequently
invoke Intersight API on behalf of this AppRegistration.
To register an OAuth2 application, the following information must be provided.
1) Application name
2) An icon for the application
3) URL to the application's home page
4) A short description of the application
5) A list of redirect URLs
When an AppRegistration is created, a unique OAuth2 clientId is generated and returned in the HTTP response.
## Argument Reference
The following arguments are supported:
* `account`:(HashMap) -(ReadOnly) A reference to a iamAccount resource.When the $expand query parameter is specified, the referenced resource is returned inline. 
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `moid`:(string) The Moid of the referenced REST resource. 
  + `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the remote type referred by this relationship. 
  + `selector`:(string) An OData $filter expression which describes the REST resource to be referenced. This field maybe set instead of 'moid' by clients.1. If 'moid' is set this field is ignored.1. If 'selector' is set and 'moid' is empty/absent from the request, Intersight determines the Moid of theresource matching the filter expression and populates it in the MoRef that is part of the objectinstance being inserted/updated to fulfill the REST request.An error is returned if the filter matches zero or more than one REST resource.An example filter string is: Serial eq '3AA8B7T11'. 
* `account_moid`:(string)(ReadOnly) The Account ID for this managed object. 
* `admin_status`:(string) Used to trigger the enable or disable action on the App Registration. These actions change the status of an App Registration.* `enable` - Used to enable a disabled API key/App Registration. If the API key/App Registration is already expired, this action has no effect.* `disable` - Used to disable an active API key/App Registration. If the API key/App Registration is already expired, this action has no effect. 
* `ancestors`:(Array)(ReadOnly) An array of relationships to moBaseMo resources. 
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `moid`:(string) The Moid of the referenced REST resource. 
  + `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the remote type referred by this relationship. 
  + `selector`:(string) An OData $filter expression which describes the REST resource to be referenced. This field maybe set instead of 'moid' by clients.1. If 'moid' is set this field is ignored.1. If 'selector' is set and 'moid' is empty/absent from the request, Intersight determines the Moid of theresource matching the filter expression and populates it in the MoRef that is part of the objectinstance being inserted/updated to fulfill the REST request.An error is returned if the filter matches zero or more than one REST resource.An example filter string is: Serial eq '3AA8B7T11'. 
* `client_id`:(string)(ReadOnly) A unique identifier for the OAuth2 client application.The client ID is auto-generated when the AppRegistration object is created. 
* `client_name`:(string) App Registration name specified by user. 
* `client_secret`:(string) The OAuth2 client secret.The value of this property is generated when grantType includes 'client-credentials'.Otherwise, no client-secret is generated. 
* `client_type`:(string) The type of the OAuth2 client (public or confidential), as specified in https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-2.1.* `public` - Clients incapable of maintaining the confidentiality of their credentials.This includes clients executing on the device used by the resource owner,such as mobile applications, installed native application or a webbrowser-based application.* `confidential` - Clients capable of maintaining the confidentiality of their credentials.For example, this could be a client implemented on a secure server withrestricted access to the client credentials.To maintain the confidentiality of the OAuth2 credentials, two use cases areconsidered.1) The application is running as a service within Intersight. The application automatically   obtains the OAuth2 credentials when the application starts and the credentials are not   exposed to the end-user.   Because end-users (even account administrators) do not have access the OAuth2 credentials,   they cannot take the credentials with them when they leave their organization.2) The application is under the control of a \ trusted\  end-user. For example,   the end-user may create a native application running outside Intersight. The application   uses OAuth2 credentials to interact with the Intersight API. In that case, the Intersight   account administrator may generate OAuth2 credentials with a registered application   using \ client_credentials\  grant type.   In that case, the end-user is responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of the   OAuth2 credentials. If the end-user leaves the organization, you should revoke the   credentials and issue new Oauth2 credentials.Here is a possible workflow for handling OAuth2 tokens.1) User Alice (Intersight Account Administrator) logins to Intersight and deploys an Intersight   application that requires an OAuth2 token.2) Intersight automatically deploys the application. The application is assigned a OAuth2 token,   possibly linked to Alice. The application must NOT expose the OAuth2 secret to Alice, otherwise   Alice would be able to use the token after she leaves the company.3) The application can make API calls to Intersight using its assigned OAuth2 token. For example,   the application could make weekly scheduled API calls to Intersight.4) Separately, Alice may also get OAuth2 tokens that she can use to make API calls from the   Intersight SDK through the northbound API. In that case, Alice will get the associated OAuth2   secrets, but not the one assigned in step #2.5) Alice leaves the organization. The OAuth2 tokens assigned in step #2 must retain their validity   even after Alice has left the organization. Because the OAuth2 secrets were never shared with   Alice, there is no risk Alice can reuse the OAuth2 secrets.   On the other hand, the OAuth2 tokens assigned in step #4 must be invalidated because Alice had   the OAuth2 tokens in her possession.

This period is determined by adding the 'startTime' property of the App Registration to the maximum expiry time configured at the account level.
