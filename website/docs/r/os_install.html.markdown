# Resource: intersight_os_install
This MO models the target server, answers and other properties needed for
OS installation. The OS installation can be started in the target server by doing
a POST on this MO.
The requests to this MO starts a OS installation workflow that can be tracked
using workflow engine MO workflow.WorkflowInfo.
## Usage Example
### Resource Creation

```hcl
resource "intersight_os_install" "os1" {
  name = "InstallTemplatee165"
  server {
    object_type = "compute.RackUnit"
    moid        = var.server_moid
  }
  image {
    object_type = "softwarerepository.OperatingSystemFile"
    moid        = var.osf1
  }
  osdu_image {
    moid        = var.scu1
    object_type = "firmware.ServerConfigurationUtilityDistributable"
  }
  answers {
    answer_file = var.answer_file
    nr_source   = "File"
    object_type = "os.Answers"
  }
  description    = "Install Template 5"

  + `is_value_set`:(bool) Flag to indicate if value is set. Value will be used to check if any edit. 
  + `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type.The value should be the same as the 'ClassId' property. 
  + `type`:(JSON as string) Definition of place holder. 
  + `value`:(JSON as string) Value for placeholder provided by user.

  + `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the remote type referred by this relationship. 
  + `selector`:(string) An OData $filter expression which describes the REST resource to be referenced. This field maybe set instead of 'moid' by clients.1. If 'moid' is set this field is ignored.1. If 'selector' is set and 'moid' is empty/absent from the request, Intersight determines the Moid of theresource matching the filter expression and populates it in the MoRef that is part of the objectinstance being inserted/updated to fulfill the REST request.An error is returned if the filter matches zero or more than one REST resource.An example filter string is: Serial eq '3AA8B7T11'. 
* `answers`:(HashMap) - Answers provided by user for the unattended OS installation. 
This complex property has following sub-properties:
