# Resource: intersight_os_install
This MO models the target server, answers and other properties needed for
OS installation. The OS installation can be started in the target server by doing
a POST on this MO.
The requests to this MO starts a OS installation workflow that can be tracked
using workflow engine MO workflow.WorkflowInfo.
## Usage Example
### Resource Creation

```hcl
resource "intersight_os_install" "os1" {
  name = "InstallTemplatee165"
  server {
    object_type = "compute.RackUnit"
    moid        = var.server_moid
  }
  image {
    object_type = "softwarerepository.OperatingSystemFile"
    moid        = var.osf1
  }
  osdu_image {
    moid        = var.scu1
    object_type = "firmware.ServerConfigurationUtilityDistributable"
  }
  answers {
    answer_file = var.answer_file
    nr_source   = "File"
    object_type = "os.Answers"
  }
  description    = "Install Template 5"

* `account_moid`:(string)(ReadOnly) The Account ID for this managed object. 
* `additional_parameters`:(Array)
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `is_value_set`:(bool) Flag to indicate if value is set. Value will be used to check if any edit. 
  + `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type.The value should be the same as the 'ClassId' property. 
  + `type`:(JSON as string) Definition of place holder. 
  + `value`:(JSON as string) Value for placeholder provided by user. 
* `ancestors`:(Array)(ReadOnly) An array of relationships to moBaseMo resources. 
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `moid`:(string) The Moid of the referenced REST resource. 
  + `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the remote type referred by this relationship. 
  + `selector`:(string) An OData $filter expression which describes the REST resource to be referenced. This field maybe set instead of 'moid' by clients.1. If 'moid' is set this field is ignored.1. If 'selector' is set and 'moid' is empty/absent from the request, Intersight determines the Moid of theresource matching the filter expression and populates it in the MoRef that is part of the objectinstance being inserted/updated to fulfill the REST request.An error is returned if the filter matches zero or more than one REST resource.An example filter string is: Serial eq '3AA8B7T11'. 
* `answers`:(HashMap) - Answers provided by user for the unattended OS installation. 
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `answer_file`:(string) If the source of the answers is a static file, the content of the file is stored as valuein this property.The value is mandatory only when the 'Source' property has been set to 'File'. 
  + `hostname`:(string) Hostname to be configured for the server in the OS. 
  + `ip_config_type`:(string) IP configuration type. Values are Static or Dynamic configuration of IP.In case of static IP configuration, IP address, gateway and other details needto be populated. In case of dynamic the IP configuration is obtained dynamicallyfrom DHCP.* `static` - In case of static IP configuraton, provide the details such as IP address, netmask, and gateway.* `DHCP` - In case of dynamic IP configuration, the IP address, netmask and gateway detailsare obtained from DHCP.

This complex property has following sub-properties:
    + `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type.The value should be the same as the 'ClassId' property.The enum values provides the list of concrete types that can be instantiated from this abstract type.

'File'option indicates that the answers are provided as a file. 'Template' indicates that theplaceholders in the selected os.ConfigurationFile MO are replaced with values providedas os.Answers MO.* `None` - Indicates that answers is not sent and values must be populated from Install Template.  * `Embedded` - Indicates that the answer file is embedded within OS image.* `File` - Indicates that the answer file is a static content that has all thevalues populated.* `Template` - Indicates that the given answers are used to populate the answer filetemplate. The template allows the users to refer some server specificanswers as fields/placeholders and replace these placeholders with theactual values for each Server during OS installation using 'Answers' and'AdditionalParameters' properties in os.Install MO.The answer file templates can be created by users as os.ConfigurationFile objects.
