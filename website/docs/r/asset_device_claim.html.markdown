        DeviceClaim captures the intent to claim a device to an Intersight account. A device can be unclaimed by performing a DELETE on a DeviceClaim instance. When performing a claim, a secret passphrase must be obtained from the device connector UI/API by a sufficiently privileged user. The passphrase is timebound and proves that the user currently has privileged administrative access to the device being claimed.

# Resource: intersight_asset_device_claim
DeviceClaim captures the intent to claim a device to an Intersight account. A device can be unclaimed by performing a DELETE on a DeviceClaim instance. When performing a claim, a secret passphrase must be obtained from the device connector UI/API by a sufficiently privileged user. The passphrase is timebound and proves that the user currently has privileged administrative access to the device being claimed.
## Argument Reference
The following arguments are supported:
* `account`:(HashMap) -(ReadOnly) A reference to a iamAccount resource.When the $expand query parameter is specified, the referenced resource is returned inline. 
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `moid`:(string) The Moid of the referenced REST resource. 
  + `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the remote type referred by this relationship. 
  + `selector`:(string) An OData $filter expression which describes the REST resource to be referenced. This field maybe set instead of 'moid' by clients.1. If 'moid' is set this field is ignored.1. If 'selector' is set and 'moid' is empty/absent from the request, Intersight determines the Moid of theresource matching the filter expression and populates it in the MoRef that is part of the objectinstance being inserted/updated to fulfill the REST request.An error is returned if the filter matches zero or more than one REST resource.An example filter string is: Serial eq '3AA8B7T11'. 
* `account_moid`:(string)(ReadOnly) The Account ID for this managed object. 
* `ancestors`:(Array)(ReadOnly) An array of relationships to moBaseMo resources.

This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `account`:(string) The account id to which the device belongs. 
  + `connector_version`:(string) The version of the device connector currently running on the platform.

There can only be one primary in a given cluster, while the underlying platform may be active-active only one connector will assume the primary role.* `Secondary` - The node has been elected as a secondary node in the cluster. The device connector will establish a connection to the Intersight service with limited capabilities. e.g. file upload will be enabled, but requests to the underlying platform management will be disabled.
