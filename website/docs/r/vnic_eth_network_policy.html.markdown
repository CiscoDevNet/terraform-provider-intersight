# Resource: intersight_vnic_eth_network_policy
An Ethernet Network policy determines if the port can carry single VLAN (Access) or multiple VLANs (Trunk) traffic. You can specify the VLAN to be associated with an Ethernet packet if no tag is found.
## Usage Example
### Resource Creation

```hcl
resource "intersight_vnic_eth_network_policy" "v_eth_network1" {
  name = "v_eth_network1"
  organization {
    object_type = "organization.Organization"
    moid        = var.organization
  }
  vlan_settings {
    object_type  = "vnic.VlanSettings"
    default_vlan = 1
    mode         = "ACCESS"
  }
}
variable "organization" {
   type = string
   description = "<value for organization>"
 }
```
## Argument Reference
The following arguments are supported:
* `account_moid`:(string)(ReadOnly) The Account ID for this managed object. 
* `ancestors`:(Array)(ReadOnly) An array of relationships to moBaseMo resources. 
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `moid`:(string) The Moid of the referenced REST resource. 
  + `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the remote type referred by this relationship. 
  + `selector`:(string) An OData $filter expression which describes the REST resource to be referenced. This field maybe set instead of 'moid' by clients.1. If 'moid' is set this field is ignored.1. If 'selector' is set and 'moid' is empty/absent from the request, Intersight determines the Moid of theresource matching the filter expression and populates it in the MoRef that is part of the objectinstance being inserted/updated to fulfill the REST request.An error is returned if the filter matches zero or more than one REST resource.An example filter string is: Serial eq '3AA8B7T11'.

* `shared_scope`:(string)(ReadOnly) Intersight provides pre-built workflows, tasks and policies to end users through global catalogs.Objects that are made available through global catalogs are said to have a 'shared' ownership. Shared objects are either made globally available to all end users or restricted to end users based on their license entitlement.
