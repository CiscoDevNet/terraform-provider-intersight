# Resource: intersight_vnic_eth_network_policy
An Ethernet Network policy determines if the port can carry single VLAN (Access) or multiple VLANs (Trunk) traffic. You can specify the VLAN to be associated with an Ethernet packet if no tag is found.
## Usage Example
### Resource Creation

```hcl
resource "intersight_vnic_eth_network_policy" "v_eth_network1" {
  name = "v_eth_network1"
  organization {
    object_type = "organization.Organization"
    moid        = var.organization
  }
  vlan_settings {
    object_type  = "vnic.VlanSettings"
    default_vlan = 1
    mode         = "ACCESS"
  }
}
variable "organization" {
   type = string
   description = "<value for organization>"
 }
```
## Argument Reference
The following arguments are supported:
* `account_moid`:(string)(ReadOnly) The Account ID for this managed object. 
* `ancestors`:(Array)(ReadOnly) An array of relationships to moBaseMo resources. 
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `moid`:(string) The Moid of the referenced REST resource. 
  + `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the remote type referred by this relationship. 
  + `selector`:(string) An OData $filter expression which describes the REST resource to be referenced. This field maybe set instead of 'moid' by clients.1. If 'moid' is set this field is ignored.1. If 'selector' is set and 'moid' is empty/absent from the request, Intersight determines the Moid of theresource matching the filter expression and populates it in the MoRef that is part of the objectinstance being inserted/updated to fulfill the REST request.An error is returned if the filter matches zero or more than one REST resource.An example filter string is: Serial eq '3AA8B7T11'.

* `name`:(string) Name of the concrete policy. 
* `organization`:(HashMap) - A reference to a organizationOrganization resource.When the $expand query parameter is specified, the referenced resource is returned inline.

* `shared_scope`:(string)(ReadOnly) Intersight provides pre-built workflows, tasks and policies to end users through global catalogs.Objects that are made available through global catalogs are said to have a 'shared' ownership. Shared objects are either made globally available to all end users or restricted to end users based on their license entitlement.

Currently the only supported value is \ Configured\ that is used to keep track of snapshots of policies and profiles that are intendedto be configured to target endpoints.* `Modified` - Version created every time an object is modified.* `Configured` - Version created every time an object is configured to the service profile.* `Deployed` - Version created for objects related to a service profile when it is deployed. 
* `vlan_settings`:(HashMap) - VLAN configuration for the virtual interface. 
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `allowed_vlans`:(string) Allowed VLAN IDs of the virtual interface. 
  + `default_vlan`:(int) Native VLAN ID of the virtual interface or the corresponding vethernet on the peer Fabric Interconnect to which the virtual interface is connected. Setting the ID to 0 will not associate any native VLAN to the traffic on the virtual interface. 
  + `mode`:(string) Option to determine if the port can carry single VLAN (Access) or multiple VLANs (Trunk) traffic.* `ACCESS` - An access port carries traffic only for a single VLAN on the interface.* `TRUNK` - A trunk port can have two or more VLANs configured on the interface. It can carry traffic for several VLANs simultaneously. 
  + `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type.The value should be the same as the 'ClassId' property.
