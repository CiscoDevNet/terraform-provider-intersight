# Resource: intersight_os_configuration_file
A ConfigurationFile is an OS specific answer file that helps with the unattended
installation.
The file can also be a template file with placeholders instead of actual answers.
Intersight supports the golang template syntax specified in https://golang.org/pkg/text/template/.
The template supports placeholders for all the properties of os.Answers MO type
as well as any additional user-defined properties. The values for these placeholders
shall be given during OS installation in the form of os.Answers type and 'additionalProperties' in
os.OsInstall object.
## Usage Example
### Resource Creation

```hcl
resource "intersight_os_configuration_file" "os_configuration_file1" {
  name = "os_configuration_file1"
  placeholders = [{
    object_type  = "os.PlaceHolder"
    is_value_set = true
    type = {
      object_type = "workflow.PrimitiveDataType"
      default = {
        object_type = "workflow.DefaultValue"
        override    = false
        value       = "<default value of the data_type>"
      }
      description = "Description for the Default data type"
      display_meta = {
        object_type        = "workflow.DisplayMeta"
        inventory_selector = true
        widget_type        = "Radio"
      }
    }
  }]
  catalog {
    object_type = "os.Catalog"
    moid        = var.catalog
  }
  version {
    object_type = "hcl.OperatingSystem "
    moid        = var.hcl.OperatingSystem
  }
}
```
