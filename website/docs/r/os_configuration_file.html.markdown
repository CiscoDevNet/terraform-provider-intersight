# Resource: intersight_os_configuration_file
A ConfigurationFile is an OS specific answer file that helps with the unattended
installation.
The file can also be a template file with placeholders instead of actual answers.
Intersight supports the golang template syntax specified in https://golang.org/pkg/text/template/.
The template supports placeholders for all the properties of os.Answers MO type
as well as any additional user-defined properties. The values for these placeholders
shall be given during OS installation in the form of os.Answers type and 'additionalProperties' in
os.OsInstall object.
## Usage Example
### Resource Creation

```hcl
resource "intersight_os_configuration_file" "os_configuration_file1" {
  name = "os_configuration_file1"
  placeholders {
    class_id     = "os.PlaceHolder"
    object_type  = "os.PlaceHolder"
    is_value_set = true
    type {
      object_type = "workflow.PrimitiveDataType"
      class_id    = "workflow.PrimitiveDataType"
      properties {
        class_id    = "workflow.PrimitiveDataType"
        object_type = "workflow.PrimitiveDataType"
        secure      = false
      }
      default {
        object_type = "workflow.DefaultValue"
        override    = false
        value       = "<default value of the data_type>"
      }
      description = "Description for the Default data type"
      display_meta {
        class_id           = "workflow.DisplayMeta"
        object_type        = "workflow.DisplayMeta"
        inventory_selector = true
        widget_type        = "Radio"
      }
    }
  }
  catalog {
    object_type = "os.Catalog"
    moid        = var.catalog
  }
  distributions {
    object_type = "hcl.OperatingSystem"
    moid        = var.hcl_OperatingSystem
  }
}

variable "catalog" {
  type        = string
  description = "value for catalog"
}

variable "hcl_OperatingSystem" {
  type        = string
  description = "value for hcl_OperatingSystem"
}
```
## Argument Reference
The following arguments are supported:

* `ancestors`:(Array)(ReadOnly) An array of relationships to moBaseMo resources. 
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `moid`:(string) The Moid of the referenced REST resource. 
  + `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the remote type referred by this relationship. 
  + `selector`:(string) An OData $filter expression which describes the REST resource to be referenced. This field maybe set instead of 'moid' by clients.1. If 'moid' is set this field is ignored.1. If 'selector' is set and 'moid' is empty/absent from the request, Intersight determines the Moid of theresource matching the filter expression and populates it in the MoRef that is part of the objectinstance being inserted/updated to fulfill the REST request.An error is returned if the filter matches zero or more than one REST resource.An example filter string is: Serial eq '3AA8B7T11'.
