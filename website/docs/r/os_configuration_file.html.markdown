# Resource: intersight_os_configuration_file
A ConfigurationFile is an OS specific answer file that helps with the unattended
installation.
The file can also be a template file with placeholders instead of actual answers.
Intersight supports the golang template syntax specified in https://golang.org/pkg/text/template/.
The template supports placeholders for all the properties of os.Answers MO type
as well as any additional user-defined properties. The values for these placeholders
shall be given during OS installation in the form of os.Answers type and 'additionalProperties' in
os.OsInstall object.
## Usage Example
### Resource Creation

```hcl
resource "intersight_os_configuration_file" "os_configuration_file1" {
  name = "os_configuration_file1"
  placeholders {
    class_id     = "os.PlaceHolder"
    object_type  = "os.PlaceHolder"
    is_value_set = true
    type {
      object_type = "workflow.PrimitiveDataType"
      class_id    = "workflow.PrimitiveDataType"
      properties {
        class_id    = "workflow.PrimitiveDataType"
        object_type = "workflow.PrimitiveDataType"
        secure      = false
      }
      default {
        object_type = "workflow.DefaultValue"
        override    = false
        value       = "<default value of the data_type>"
      }
      description = "Description for the Default data type"
      display_meta {
        class_id           = "workflow.DisplayMeta"
        object_type        = "workflow.DisplayMeta"
        inventory_selector = true
        widget_type        = "Radio"
      }
    }
  }
  catalog {
    object_type = "os.Catalog"
    moid        = var.catalog
  }
  distributions {
    object_type = "hcl.OperatingSystem"
    moid        = var.hcl_OperatingSystem
  }
}

variable "catalog" {
  type        = string
  description = "value for catalog"
}

variable "hcl_OperatingSystem" {
  type        = string
  description = "value for hcl_OperatingSystem"
}
```
## Argument Reference
The following arguments are supported:
