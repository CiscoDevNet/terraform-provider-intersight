# Resource: intersight_workflow_workflow_definition
Workflow definition is a collection of tasks that are sequenced in a certain way using control tasks. The tasks in the workflow definition is represented as a directed acyclic graph where each node in the graph is a task and the edges in the graph are transitions from one task to another.
## Usage Example
### Resource Creation

```hcl
resource "intersight_workflow_workflow_definition" "workflow_workflow_definition1" {
  name  = "workflow_workflow_definition1"
  label = "Value for label"
  output_definition {
    class_id    = "workflow.StartTask"
    object_type = "workflow.PrimitiveDataType"
    name        = "status"
    label       = "Value for label"
    required    = false
    description = "Value for description"
    default {
      object_type = "workflow.DefaultValue"
      override    = false
      class_id    = "workflow.DefaultValue"

Adjusting the number of batches also allows you to control how many iterations run in parallel. For example, if the total count is 100 and you set the number of batches to 5, then 20 tasks will run in parallel across the 5 batches. It's important to note that the number of batches must be less than the total count. If the count is dynamic and falls below the number of batches, this may result in empty batches with no tasks.

Dynamic values for count must be specified as a template. For example, if a loop must run for a count which matches the length of a workflow input called StringArray, then the count must be specified using a template '{{ len .global.workflow.input.StringArray }}'. The count must be less than or equal to 100. If count is given as a dynamic value, and during execution time if count evaluates to be a value greater than 100, then the loop task will fail. 
* `loop_start_task`:(string) Start task where the list of tasks will be executed multiple times based on the count or condition value. 
* `on_failure`:(string) This specifies the name of the next task to run if all iterations of the loop task do not succeed. The unique name given to the task instance within the workflow must be provided here. In a graph model, denotes an edge to another Task Node.

  + `name`:(string) Descriptive name for the data type. Name can only contain letters (a-z, A-Z), numbers (0-9), hyphen (-) or an underscore (_). The first and last character in name must be an alphanumeric character. 
  + `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type.The value should be the same as the 'ClassId' property.The enum values provides the list of concrete types that can be instantiated from this abstract type. 
  + `required`:(bool) Specifies whether this parameter is required. The field is applicable for task and workflow. 
* `prompts`:(Array)
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `description`:(string) Description that give more details about what it means to pick this prompt option for the wait task. 
  + `label`:(string) User friendly label for the prompt. This label will be shown to the user as one of available options for the wait task. 
  + `name`:(string) Name for the wait prompt. 
  + `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type.The value should be the same as the 'ClassId' property. 
  + `task_status`:(string) Task status for the wait task when this prompt option is selected.* `Scheduled` - The enum represents the status when task is in scheduled state.* `InProgress` - The enum represents the status when task is in-progress state.* `NoOp` - The enum represents the status when task is a noop.* `Timeout` - The enum represents the status when task has timed out.* `Completed` - The enum represents the status when task has completed.* `Failed` - The enum represents the status when task has failed. 
* `rollback_disabled`:(bool) The task is disabled/enabled for rollback operation in this workflow if the task has rollback support. 
* `variable_parameters`:(JSON as string) JSON formatted key-value pairs that perform variable update at the end of the task execution. Mapping for variables can be provided as either static values, direct mapping or advanced mapping using templates. The direct mapping can be specified as '${Source.< input | output | variable>.<JSONPath>}'. 'Source' can be either workflow or the name of the current or an earlier task within the workflow. You can map the variable to either a workflow input, a task output or another variable. Golang template syntax is supported for advanced mapping. A simple flattened example is \ VariableParameters\ :{ \ var1\ :\ ${task1.output.output1}\ , \ var2\ :\ {{ Itoa .global.workflow.variable.varInt}}\  } where variable var1 is mapped directly to output1 of task1 and variable var2 is using a template to convert another variable varInt to string and assign that value. 

### [workflow.WorkerTask](#argument-reference)
A WorkerTask is a simple task and the smallest granularity of work that can be defined as a task.
* `catalog_moid`:(string) Specify the catalog moid that this task belongs. 
* `input_parameters`:(JSON as string) JSON formatted key-value pairs that define the inputs given to the task. Mapping for task inputs can be provided as either static values, direct mapping or advanced mapping using templates. The direct mapping can be specified as '${Source.< input | output | variable>.<JSONPath>}'. 'Source' can be either workflow or the name of an earlier task within the workflow. You can map the task input to either a workflow input, a task output or a variable. Golang template syntax is supported for advanced mapping. A simple flattened example is \ InputParameters\ :{ \ input1\ :\ ${workflow.variable.var1}\ , \ input2\ :\ prefixStr_{{.global.workflow.input.input1}}\  } where task input1 is mapped directly to variable var1 and task input2 is using a template to prefix a string to workflow input1 and then assign that value. 
* `on_failure`:(string) This specifies the name of the next task to run if Task fails.  This is the unique name given to the task instance within the workflow. In a graph model, denotes an edge to another Task Node. 
* `on_success`:(string) This specifies the name of the next task to run if Task succeeds.  This is the unique name given to the task instance within the workflow. In a graph model, denotes an edge to another Task Node. 
* `rollback_disabled`:(bool) The task is disabled/enabled for rollback operation in this workflow if the task has rollback support. 
* `task_definition_id`:(string)(ReadOnly) The resolved referenced task definition managed object. 
* `task_definition_name`:(string) The qualified name of task that should be executed. 
* `variable_parameters`:(JSON as string) JSON formatted key-value pairs that perform variable update at the end of the task execution. Mapping for variables can be provided as either static values, direct mapping or advanced mapping using templates. The direct mapping can be specified as '${Source.< input | output | variable>.<JSONPath>}'. 'Source' can be either workflow or the name of the current or an earlier task within the workflow. You can map the variable to either a workflow input, a task output or another variable. Golang template syntax is supported for advanced mapping. A simple flattened example is \ VariableParameters\ :{ \ var1\ :\ ${task1.output.output1}\ , \ var2\ :\ {{ Itoa .global.workflow.variable.varInt}}\  } where variable var1 is mapped directly to output1 of task1 and variable var2 is using a template to convert another variable varInt to string and assign that value. 
* `nr_version`:(int) The task definition version to use in this workflow. When no version is specified then the default version of the task at the time of creating or updating this workflow is used.
