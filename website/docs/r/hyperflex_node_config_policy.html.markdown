# Resource: intersight_hyperflex_node_config_policy
A policy specifying node details such as management and storage data IP ranges. For HyperFlex Edge, storage data IP range is pre-defined.
## Usage Example
### Resource Creation

```hcl
resource "intersight_hyperflex_node_config_policy" "hyperflex_node_config_policy1" {
  mgmt_ip_range {
    end_addr   = "10.225.68.240"
    gateway    = "10.225.68.1"
    netmask    = "255.255.255.0"
    start_addr = "10.225.68.238"
  }
  hxdp_ip_range {
    end_addr   = "10.225.68.243"
    gateway    = "10.225.68.1"
    netmask    = "255.255.255.0"
    start_addr = "10.225.68.241"
  }

## Argument Reference
The following arguments are supported:
