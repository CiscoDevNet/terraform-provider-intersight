### [workflow.MoReferenceForCloneDataType](#argument-reference)
Data type captures a reference to an Intersight Managed Object (MO) that serves as the source for cloning and creating an input object. The fields to be passed as for this datatype will be SourceMoid for the Source MO and the ObjectType which is the qualified name for the MO. When a clone is created, the Moid field of the new object is populated with the cloned object ID. After the cloning process is complete, the SourceMoid field is removed, leaving only Moid and ObjectType in the input. The identity properties of the cloned object are assigned by the consuming module. For instance, when used in Workload definitions to clone a LDAP policy, the policy identity — such as its Name — is determined based on the Workload definition name combined with the source policy name.
