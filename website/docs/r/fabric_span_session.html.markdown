# Resource: intersight_fabric_span_session
Configures an Ethernet SPAN session per Fabric Interconnect.
## Argument Reference
The following arguments are supported:
* `account_moid`:(string)(ReadOnly) The Account ID for this managed object. 
* `admin_state`:(string) Admin state to enable or disable the SPAN session.* `Disabled` - Admin configured Disabled State.* `Enabled` - Admin configured Enabled State. 
* `ancestors`:(Array)(ReadOnly) An array of relationships to moBaseMo resources. 
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `moid`:(string) The Moid of the referenced REST resource. 
  + `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the remote type referred by this relationship. 
  + `selector`:(string) An OData $filter expression which describes the REST resource to be referenced. This field maybe set instead of 'moid' by clients.1. If 'moid' is set this field is ignored.1. If 'selector' is set and 'moid' is empty/absent from the request, Intersight determines the Moid of theresource matching the filter expression and populates it in the MoRef that is part of the objectinstance being inserted/updated to fulfill the REST request.An error is returned if the filter matches zero or more than one REST resource.An example filter string is: Serial eq '3AA8B7T11'. 
* `config_state`:(string)(ReadOnly) The configured state of SPAN configuration. If the configuration fails to deploy to the Fabric Interconnect, it can be redeployed by toggling the admin state.* `None` - Nil value when no action has been triggered by the user.* `Applied` - User configured settings are in applied state.* `Applying` - User settings are being applied on the target server.* `Failed` - User configured settings could not be applied.* `Scheduled` - User configured settings are scheduled to be applied.
