        The vHBA template consists of the common vHBA configuration, which can be reused across multiple vHBAs. vHBAs can be created from the template using the Derive operation. Additionally, an existing vHBA can be attached to a template to use the configuration set in the template.
        To derive vHBAs from a vHBA template, you must use the asynchronous /v1/bulk/MoCloners bulk API.

        The API response includes the AsyncResult->bulk.Result MO reference. API clients must poll the bulk.Result MO to monitor the status of the operation.
        The bulk.Result object also includes a reference to a monitoring workflow, which is accessible from the 'Requests' tab in the UI.
        Managing Template Updates
        When the vHBA template is updated, the system initiates an automatic call to the /v1/bulk/MoMergers API to synchronize the template changes to all derived vHBA instances asynchronously. The status of the sync operation can be obtained by performing a query on vnic EthIf MO -
        $filter=SrcTemplate.Moid eq 'xxx'&$apply=groupby ( (TemplateSyncStatus), aggregate ($count as count))
        Override Option for vHBA Templates
        When enabled, this feature allows the configuration of the derived vHBA to override the configuration available in the template during vHBA create or update.
        You can query the list of overridable properties for a vHBA template from the Template Catalog. Use the following catalog API query:
        URL: /v1/capability/TemplateCatalogs
        Query: $filter= (Name eq ‘VhbaTemplate’)&$select=AllowedOverrideList
        Once a property is overridden on a derived vHBA, it will be added to the ‘OverriddenList’ property on the vnic FcIf MO.
        URL: /v1/vnic/FcIfs
        Query: $select=SrcTemplate, OverriddenList
        When override is disabled on the template, derived vHBA will have same configuration as the template.

Managing Template Updates
When the vHBA template is updated, the system initiates an automatic call to the /v1/bulk/MoMergers API to synchronize the template changes to all derived vHBA instances asynchronously. The status of the sync operation can be obtained by performing a query on vnic EthIf MO -
$filter=SrcTemplate.Moid eq 'xxx'&$apply=groupby ( (TemplateSyncStatus), aggregate ($count as count))
Override Option for vHBA Templates
When enabled, this feature allows the configuration of the derived vHBA to override the configuration available in the template during vHBA create or update.
You can query the list of overridable properties for a vHBA template from the Template Catalog. Use the following catalog API query:
URL: /v1/capability/TemplateCatalogs
Query: $filter= (Name eq ‘VhbaTemplate’)&$select=AllowedOverrideList
Once a property is overridden on a derived vHBA, it will be added to the ‘OverriddenList’ property on the vnic FcIf MO.
URL: /v1/vnic/FcIfs
Query: $select=SrcTemplate, OverriddenList
When override is disabled on the template, derived vHBA will have same configuration as the template.
