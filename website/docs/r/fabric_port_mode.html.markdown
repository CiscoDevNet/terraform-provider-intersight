# Resource: intersight_fabric_port_mode
Object sent by user to configure range of unified ports as FC/Ethernet or ports as breakout.
## Usage Example
### Resource Creation

```hcl
resource "intersight_fabric_port_mode" "fabric_port_mode1" {
  custom_mode   = "FibreChannel"
  port_id_end   = 8
  port_id_start = 1
  slot_id       = 1
  port_policy {
    moid = intersight_fabric_port_policy.fabric_port_policy1.moid
  }
}
```
## Argument Reference
The following arguments are supported:
* `account_moid`:(string)(Computed) The Account ID for this managed object. 
* `ancestors`:(Array)(Computed) An array of relationships to moBaseMo resources. 
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `moid`:(string) The Moid of the referenced REST resource. 
  + `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the remote type referred by this relationship. 
  + `selector`:(string) An OData $filter expression which describes the REST resource to be referenced. This field maybe set instead of 'moid' by clients.1. If 'moid' is set this field is ignored.1. If 'selector' is set and 'moid' is empty/absent from the request, Intersight determines the Moid of theresource matching the filter expression and populates it in the MoRef that is part of the objectinstance being inserted/updated to fulfill the REST request.An error is returned if the filter matches zero or more than one REST resource.An example filter string is: Serial eq '3AA8B7T11'. 
* `create_time`:(string)(Computed) The time when this managed object was created. 
* `custom_mode`:(string) Custom Port Mode specified for the port range.* `FibreChannel` - Fibre Channel Port Types.* `BreakoutEthernet10G` - Breakout Ethernet 10G Port Type.* `BreakoutEthernet25G` - Breakout Ethernet 25G Port Type. 
* `domain_group_moid`:(string)(Computed) The DomainGroup ID for this managed object. 
* `mod_time`:(string)(Computed) The time when this managed object was last modified. 
* `moid`:(string) The unique identifier of this Managed Object instance. 
* `owners`:
                (Array of schema.TypeString) -(Computed)
* `parent`:(HashMap) -(Computed) A reference to a moBaseMo resource.When the $expand query parameter is specified, the referenced resource is returned inline.

* `port_id_end`:(int) Ending range of the Port Identifier. 
* `port_id_start`:(int) Starting range of the Port Identifier. 
* `port_policy`:(HashMap) - A reference to a fabricPortPolicy resource.When the $expand query parameter is specified, the referenced resource is returned inline. 
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `moid`:(string) The Moid of the referenced REST resource. 
  + `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the remote type referred by this relationship.

* `shared_scope`:(string)(Computed) Intersight provides pre-built workflows, tasks and policies to end users through global catalogs.Objects that are made available through global catalogs are said to have a 'shared' ownership. Shared objects are either made globally available to all end users or restricted to end users based on their license entitlement. Users can use this property to differentiate the scope (global or a specific license tier) to which a shared MO belongs.
