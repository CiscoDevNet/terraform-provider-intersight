# Resource: intersight_hyperflex_cisco_hypervisor_manager
A hypervisor manager to manage Cisco HyperFlex compute clusters and is available per user account.
## Usage Example
### Resource Creation

```hcl
resource "intersight_hyperflex_cisco_hypervisor_manager" "hyperflex_cisco_hypervisor_manager1" {
  name = "hyperflex_cisco_hypervisor_manager1"
  registered_device {
    moid        = intersight_registered_device.device1.id
    object_type = "asset.DeviceRegistrations"
  }
  account {
    object_type = "iam.Account"
    moid        = intersight_iam_account.account1.id
  }
}
```
## Argument Reference
The following arguments are supported:
* `account`:(HashMap) -(Computed) A reference to a iamAccount resource.When the $expand query parameter is specified, the referenced resource is returned inline. 
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `moid`:(string) The Moid of the referenced REST resource. 
  + `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the remote type referred by this relationship. 
  + `selector`:(string) An OData $filter expression which describes the REST resource to be referenced. This field maybe set instead of 'moid' by clients.1. If 'moid' is set this field is ignored.1. If 'selector' is set and 'moid' is empty/absent from the request, Intersight determines the Moid of theresource matching the filter expression and populates it in the MoRef that is part of the objectinstance being inserted/updated to fulfill the REST request.An error is returned if the filter matches zero or more than one REST resource.An example filter string is: Serial eq '3AA8B7T11'. 
* `account_moid`:(string)(Computed) The Account ID for this managed object. 
* `ancestors`:(Array)(Computed) An array of relationships to moBaseMo resources.

* `build`:(string)(Computed) The build number of the Hypervisor Manger (e.g., 4541947, 6.3.9600.18692). The build number may indicate some feature support that applications might rely on. The build number may not always be an integer. 
* `create_time`:(string)(Computed) The time when this managed object was created. 
* `domain_group_moid`:(string)(Computed) The DomainGroup ID for this managed object. 
* `identity`:(string)(Computed) Identity of the hypervisor (not manipulated by user). It could be a UUID too. For example, c917093f-5443-4748-bc09-eec72ded7608. 
* `mod_time`:(string)(Computed) The time when this managed object was last modified. 
* `moid`:(string) The unique identifier of this Managed Object instance. 
* `name`:(string) The user provided name for the hypervisor manager. For example, vCenterIreland. Usually, this name is subject to manipulation by the user. It is not the identity of the hypervisor.

* `parent`:(HashMap) -(Computed) A reference to a moBaseMo resource.When the $expand query parameter is specified, the referenced resource is returned inline.
