# Resource: intersight_kvm_policy
Policy to configure KVM Launch settings.
## Usage Example
### Resource Creation

```hcl
resource "intersight_kvm_policy" "kvm1" {
  name                      = "kvm1"
  description               = "demo kvm policy"
  enabled                   = true
  maximum_sessions          = 3
  remote_port               = 2069
  enable_video_encryption   = true

## Argument Reference
The following arguments are supported:
* `account_moid`:(string)(ReadOnly) The Account ID for this managed object. 
* `ancestors`:(Array)(ReadOnly) An array of relationships to moBaseMo resources. 
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `moid`:(string) The Moid of the referenced REST resource. 
  + `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the remote type referred by this relationship. 
  + `selector`:(string) An OData $filter expression which describes the REST resource to be referenced. This field maybe set instead of 'moid' by clients.1. If 'moid' is set this field is ignored.1. If 'selector' is set and 'moid' is empty/absent from the request, Intersight determines the Moid of theresource matching the filter expression and populates it in the MoRef that is part of the objectinstance being inserted/updated to fulfill the REST request.An error is returned if the filter matches zero or more than one REST resource.An example filter string is: Serial eq '3AA8B7T11'. 
* `create_time`:(string)(ReadOnly) The time when this managed object was created. 
* `description`:(string) Description of the policy. 
* `domain_group_moid`:(string)(ReadOnly) The DomainGroup ID for this managed object. 
* `enable_local_server_video`:(bool) If enabled, displays KVM session on any monitor attached to the server. 
* `enable_video_encryption`:(bool) If enabled, encrypts all video information sent through KVM. Please note that this can no longer be disabled for servers running versions 4.2 and above. 
* `enabled`:(bool) State of the vKVM service on the endpoint. 
* `maximum_sessions`:(int) The maximum number of concurrent KVM sessions allowed. 
* `mod_time`:(string)(ReadOnly) The time when this managed object was last modified. 
* `moid`:(string) The unique identifier of this Managed Object instance. 
* `name`:(string) Name of the concrete policy. 
* `organization`:(HashMap) - A reference to a organizationOrganization resource.When the $expand query parameter is specified, the referenced resource is returned inline.
