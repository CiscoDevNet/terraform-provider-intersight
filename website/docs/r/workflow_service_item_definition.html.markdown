If parameter is integer/float, then maximum number supported is 1.797693134862315708145274237317043567981e+308 or (2**1023 * (2**53 - 1) / 2**52). When a number bigger than this is given as Maximum value, the constraints will not be enforced. 
  + `min`:(float) Allowed minimum value of the parameter if parameter is integer/float or minimum length of the parameter if the parameter is string. When max and min are set to 0, then the limits are not checked. If parameter is integer/float, then minimum number supported is 4.940656458412465441765687928682213723651e-324 or (1 / 2 ** (1023 - 1 + 52)). When a number smaller than this is given as minimum value, the constraints will not be enforced.
