# Resource: intersight_connectorpack_connector_pack_upgrade
Used to download or install connector packs on the target device.
## Usage Example
### Resource Creation

```hcl
resource "intersight_connectorpack_connector_pack_upgrade" "connectorpack_connector_pack_upgrade1" {
  connector_pack_op_type = "Install"
  workflow {
    object_type = "workflow.WorkflowInfo"
    moid        = var.workflow_workflow_info
  }
}

variable "workflow_workflow_info" {
  type        = string
  description = "Moid of workflow.WorkflowInfo Mo"
}
```
## Argument Reference
The following arguments are supported:
* `account_moid`:(string)(ReadOnly) The Account ID for this managed object. 
* `ancestors`:(Array)(ReadOnly) An array of relationships to moBaseMo resources. 
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `moid`:(string) The Moid of the referenced REST resource. 
  + `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the remote type referred by this relationship. 
  + `selector`:(string) An OData $filter expression which describes the REST resource to be referenced. This field maybe set instead of 'moid' by clients.1. If 'moid' is set this field is ignored.1. If 'selector' is set and 'moid' is empty/absent from the request, Intersight determines the Moid of theresource matching the filter expression and populates it in the MoRef that is part of the objectinstance being inserted/updated to fulfill the REST request.An error is returned if the filter matches zero or more than one REST resource.An example filter string is: Serial eq '3AA8B7T11'. 
* `connector_pack_op_type`:(string) The type of operation to be performed on UCS Director.* `Install` - Installs the requisite connector packs on UCS Director.* `Push` - Pushes the requisite connector packs to UCS Director. 
* `create_time`:(string)(ReadOnly) The time when this managed object was created. 
* `domain_group_moid`:(string)(ReadOnly) The DomainGroup ID for this managed object. 
* `mod_time`:(string)(ReadOnly) The time when this managed object was last modified. 
* `moid`:(string) The unique identifier of this Managed Object instance. 
* `owners`:
                (Array of schema.TypeString) -(ReadOnly)
* `parent`:(HashMap) -(ReadOnly) A reference to a moBaseMo resource.When the $expand query parameter is specified, the referenced resource is returned inline.

* `shared_scope`:(string)(ReadOnly) Intersight provides pre-built workflows, tasks and policies to end users through global catalogs.Objects that are made available through global catalogs are said to have a 'shared' ownership. Shared objects are either made globally available to all end users or restricted to end users based on their license entitlement. Users can use this property to differentiate the scope (global or a specific license tier) to which a shared MO belongs. 
* `tags`:(Array)
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `key`:(string) The string representation of a tag key. 
  + `value`:(string) The string representation of a tag value. 
* `ucsd_info`:(HashMap) - A reference to a iaasUcsdInfo resource.When the $expand query parameter is specified, the referenced resource is returned inline. 
This complex property has following sub-properties:
