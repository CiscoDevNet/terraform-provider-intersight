# Resource: intersight_adapter_config_policy
An Adapter Configuration Policy configures the Ethernet and Fibre-Channel settings for the VIC adapter.
## Usage Example
### Resource Creation

```hcl
resource "intersight_adapter_config_policy" "adapter_config1" {
  name        = "adapter_config1"
  description = "test policy"
  organization {
    object_type = "organization.Organization"
    moid        = var.organization
  }
  settings {
    object_type = "adapter.AdapterConfig"
    slot_id     = "1"
    eth_settings {
      lldp_enabled = true
      object_type  = "adapter.EthSettings"
    }
    fc_settings {
      object_type = "adapter.FcSettings"
      fip_enabled = true
    }
  }
  settings {

* `settings`:(Array)
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `dce_interface_settings`:(Array)
This complex property has following sub-properties:
    + `fec_mode`:(string) Forward Error Correction (FEC) mode setting for the DCE interfaces of the adapter. FEC mode setting is supported only for Cisco VIC 14xx adapters. FEC mode 'cl74' is unsupported for Cisco VIC 1495/1497. This setting will be ignored for unsupported adapters and for unavailable DCE interfaces.* `cl91` - Use cl91 standard as FEC mode setting. 'Clause 91' aka RS-FEC ('ReedSolomon' FEC) offers better error protection against bursty and random errors but adds latency.* `cl74` - Use cl74 standard as FEC mode setting. 'Clause 74' aka FC-FEC ('FireCode' FEC) offers simple, low-latency protection against 1 burst/sparse bit error, but it is not good for random errors.* `Off` - Disable FEC mode on the DCE Interface. 
    + `interface_id`:(int) DCE interface id on which settings needs to be configured. Supported values are (0-3). 
    + `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type.The value should be the same as the 'ClassId' property. 
  + `eth_settings`:(HashMap) - Global Ethernet settings for this adapter.

This complex property has following sub-properties:
    + `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type.The value should be the same as the 'ClassId' property. 
    + `phy_nic_enabled`:(bool) When Physical NIC Mode is enabled, up-link ports of the VIC are set to pass-through mode. This allows the host to transmit packets without any modification. When Physical NIC Mode is enabled, VLAN tagging of the packets will not happen. 
  + `port_channel_settings`:(HashMap) - Port Channel settings for this adapter. 
This complex property has following sub-properties:
    + `enabled`:(bool) When Port Channel is enabled, two vNICs and two vHBAs are available for use on the adapter card.

Shared objects are either made globally available to all end users or restricted to end users based on their license entitlement. Users can use this property to differentiate the scope (global or a specific license tier) to which a shared MO belongs.
