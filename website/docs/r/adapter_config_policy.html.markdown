## Argument Reference
The following arguments are supported:
* `account_moid`:(string)(Computed) The Account ID for this managed object. 
* `ancestors`:(Array)(Computed) An array of relationships to moBaseMo resources. 
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `moid`:(string)(Computed) The Moid of the referenced REST resource. 
  + `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the remote type referred by this relationship. 
  + `selector`:(string)(Computed) An OData $filter expression which describes the REST resource to be referenced. This field maybe set instead of 'moid' by clients.1. If 'moid' is set this field is ignored.1. If 'selector' is set and 'moid' is empty/absent from the request, Intersight determines the Moid of theresource matching the filter expression and populates it in the MoRef that is part of the objectinstance being inserted/updated to fulfill the REST request.An error is returned if the filter matches zero or more than one REST resource.An example filter string is: Serial eq '3AA8B7T11'.

* `settings`:(Array)
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `dce_interface_settings`:(Array)
This complex property has following sub-properties:
    + `fec_mode`:(string) Forward Error Correction (FEC) mode setting for the DCE interfaces of the adapter. FEC mode setting is supported only for Cisco VIC 14xx adapters. FEC mode 'cl74' is unsupported for Cisco VIC 1495/1497. This setting will be ignored for unsupported adapters and for unavailable DCE interfaces.* `cl91` - Use cl91 standard as FEC mode setting. 'Clause 91' aka RS-FEC ('ReedSolomon' FEC) offers better error protection against bursty and random errors but adds latency.* `cl74` - Use cl74 standard as FEC mode setting. 'Clause 74' aka FC-FEC ('FireCode' FEC) offers simple, low-latency protection against 1 burst/sparse bit error, but it is not good for random errors.* `Off` - Disable FEC mode on the DCE Interface. 
    + `interface_id`:(int) DCE interface id on which settings needs to be configured. Supported values are (0-3). 
    + `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type.The value should be the same as the 'ClassId' property. 
  + `eth_settings`:(HashMap) - Global Ethernet settings for this adapter. 
This complex property has following sub-properties:
    + `lldp_enabled`:(bool) Status of LLDP protocol on the adapter interfaces. 
    + `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type.The value should be the same as the 'ClassId' property. 
  + `fc_settings`:(HashMap) - Global Fibre Channel settings for this adapter. 
This complex property has following sub-properties:
    + `fip_enabled`:(bool) Status of FIP protocol on the adapter interfaces. 
    + `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type.The value should be the same as the 'ClassId' property.

  + `port_channel_settings`:(HashMap) - Port Channel settings for this adapter. 
This complex property has following sub-properties:
    + `enabled`:(bool) When Port Channel is enabled, two vNICs and two vHBAs are available for use on the adapter card. When disabled, four vNICs and four vHBAs are available for use on the adapter card. Disabling port channel reboots the server. Port Channel is supported only for Cisco VIC 1455/1457 adapters. 
    + `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type.The value should be the same as the 'ClassId' property. 
  + `slot_id`:(string) PCIe slot where the VIC adapter is installed. Supported values are (1-15) and MLOM. 
* `shared_scope`:(string)(Computed) Intersight provides pre-built workflows, tasks and policies to end users through global catalogs.Objects that are made available through global catalogs are said to have a 'shared' ownership. Shared objects are either made globally available to all end users or restricted to end users based on their license entitlement. Users can use this property to differentiate the scope (global or a specific license tier) to which a shared MO belongs.

If 'moid' is set this field is ignored.1. If 'selector' is set and 'moid' is empty/absent from the request, Intersight determines the Moid of theresource matching the filter expression and populates it in the MoRef that is part of the objectinstance being inserted/updated to fulfill the REST request.An error is returned if the filter matches zero or more than one REST resource.An example filter string is: Serial eq '3AA8B7T11'.
