# Resource: intersight_iam_ip_access_management
The access management based on IP address.
## Usage Example
### Resource Creation

```hcl
resource "intersight_iam_ip_access_management" "iam_ip_access_management1" {
  enable = true
  security_holder {
    moid        = var.iam_security_holder
    object_type = "iam.SecurityHolder"
  }
  parent {
    moid        = var.iam_system
    object_type = "iam.System"
  }
}
```
## Argument Reference
The following arguments are supported:
* `account_moid`:(string)(Computed) The Account ID for this managed object. 
* `ancestors`:(Array)(Computed) An array of relationships to moBaseMo resources. 
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `moid`:(string) The Moid of the referenced REST resource. 
  + `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the remote type referred by this relationship. 
  + `selector`:(string) An OData $filter expression which describes the REST resource to be referenced. This field maybe set instead of 'moid' by clients.1. If 'moid' is set this field is ignored.1. If 'selector' is set and 'moid' is empty/absent from the request, Intersight determines the Moid of theresource matching the filter expression and populates it in the MoRef that is part of the objectinstance being inserted/updated to fulfill the REST request.An error is returned if the filter matches zero or more than one REST resource.An example filter string is: Serial eq '3AA8B7T11'. 
* `create_time`:(string)(Computed) The time when this managed object was created. 
* `domain_group_moid`:(string)(Computed) The DomainGroup ID for this managed object. 
* `enable`:(bool) Flag stores the state of IP address based access management. Access management is enabled when it's true. 
* `holder`:(HashMap) -(Computed) A reference to a iamSecurityHolder resource.When the $expand query parameter is specified, the referenced resource is returned inline.

* `last_recovery_time`:(string)(Computed) The access to account gets locked out if wrong IP addresses are configured. Account Administrators have privilege to unblock the account. It stores the time when the account was last recovered from lock out. 
* `mod_time`:(string)(Computed) The time when this managed object was last modified. 
* `moid`:(string) The unique identifier of this Managed Object instance.
