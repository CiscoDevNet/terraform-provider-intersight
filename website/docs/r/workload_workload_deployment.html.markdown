# Resource: intersight_workload_workload_deployment
A deployment for a workload definition within an Organization. All resources which match the qualification criteria given in Workload and deployment will be configured through this Workload Deployment.
## Argument Reference
The following arguments are supported:
* `account_moid`:(string)(ReadOnly) The Account ID for this managed object. 
* `action`:(string) The action is performed on the deployment.* `None` - No changes have been made.* `PrepareToDeploy` - Marks the deployment as ready once the user has completed all changes and the deployment is in a valid state. Once the deployment is marked as PrepareToDeploy, workload instances will be created, but the actual deployment will occur as part of the deploy action.* `Deploy` - Initiates the process of pushing workload configuration to the instances based on the configured schedule. Once deployed, the deployment cannot be reverted to draft status.* `Suspend` - Suspends the deployment, preventing any further actions until it is resumed. Making changes to deployment configuration will not be pushed out. The deployment will not take any changes from the attached Workload when it is suspended.* `Retry` - Retries the deployment for all instances that previously failed.* `Resume` - Resumes a suspended deployment. Any changes made to the deployment when it was suspended or any changes made to the attached Workload will now be pushed out based on configured schedules.
