Captures a customized data type definition that can be used for task or workflow input/output. This can be reused across multiple tasks and workflow definitions.
## Usage Example
### Resource Creation

```hcl
resource "intersight_workflow_custom_data_type_definition" "workflow_custom_data_type_definition1" {
  name        = "workflow_custom_data_type_definition1"
  description = "captures a customized data type definition for workflow input/output"
  label       = "custom_data_dfn1"
  catalog {
    object_type = "workflow.Catalog"
    moid        = var.workflow_catalog
  }
  parameter_set = [{
