# Resource: intersight_hyperflex._cluster_profile
A profile specifying configuration settings for a HyperFlex cluster.
## Argument Reference
The following arguments are supported:
* `action`:(string) User initiated action. Each profile type has its own supported actions. For HyperFlex cluster profile, the supported actions are -- Validate, Deploy, Continue, Retry, Abort, Unassign For server profile, the support actions are -- Deploy, Unassign. 
* `additional_properties`:
(Array with Maximum of one item) - Add additional properties in json format inside `jsonencode()` for this object.
* `associated_cluster`:(Array with Maximum of one item) - A reference to a hyperflexCluster resource.When the $expand query parameter is specified, the referenced resource is returned inline.
