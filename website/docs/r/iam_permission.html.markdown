# Resource: intersight_iam_permission
Permission provides a way to assign roles to a user or user group to perform operations on object hierarchy.
## Usage Example
### Resource Creation

```hcl
resource "intersight_iam_permission" "iam_permission1" {
  account {
    moid        = var.iam_account
    object_type = "iam.Account"
  }
  #description = "As a Device Technician you can claim a device view the device details license status a list of\nthe claimed devices and generate API keys. You cannot perform any other management or\nadministrative task in this role.\n"
  name = "Device Technician"
  parent {
    moid        = var.iam_account
    object_type = "iam.Account"
  }
  roles {
    moid        = var.iam_role
    object_type = "iam.Role"
  }
  users {
    moid        = var.iam_user
    object_type = "iam.User"
  }
}

variable "iam_role" {
  type        = string
  description = "value for iam role"
}

variable "iam_account" {
  type        = string
  description = "value for iam account"
}

variable "iam_user" {
  type        = string
  description = "value for iam user"
}
```
## Argument Reference
The following arguments are supported:
* `account`:(HashMap) -(ReadOnly) A reference to a iamAccount resource.When the $expand query parameter is specified, the referenced resource is returned inline. 
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `moid`:(string) The Moid of the referenced REST resource. 
  + `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the remote type referred by this relationship. 
  + `selector`:(string) An OData $filter expression which describes the REST resource to be referenced. This field maybe set instead of 'moid' by clients.1. If 'moid' is set this field is ignored.1. If 'selector' is set and 'moid' is empty/absent from the request, Intersight determines the Moid of theresource matching the filter expression and populates it in the MoRef that is part of the objectinstance being inserted/updated to fulfill the REST request.An error is returned if the filter matches zero or more than one REST resource.An example filter string is: Serial eq '3AA8B7T11'.
