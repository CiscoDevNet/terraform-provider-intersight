# Resource: intersight_access_policy
Policy to configure server or chassis management options.
## Usage Example
### Resource Creation

```hcl
resource "intersight_access_policy" "access1" {
  name        = "access1"
  description = "demo imc access policy"
  inband_vlan = 19
  inband_ip_pool {
    object_type = "ippool.Pool"
    moid        = var.inband_ip_pool
  }
  organization {
    object_type = "organization.Organization"
    moid        = var.organization
  }
}

variable "inband_ip_pool" {
  type        = string
  description = "Moid of ippool.Pool Mo"
}
```
## Argument Reference
The following arguments are supported:
* `account_moid`:(string)(ReadOnly) The Account ID for this managed object. 
* `address_type`:(HashMap) - The type of address to be retrieved from Inband IP Pool object. 
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `enable_ip_v4`:(bool) This flag enables the use of IPv4 address for end-point access. 
  + `enable_ip_v6`:(bool) This flag enables the use of IPv6 address for end-point access. 
  + `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type.The value should be the same as the 'ClassId' property. 
* `ancestors`:(Array)(ReadOnly) An array of relationships to moBaseMo resources. 
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `moid`:(string) The Moid of the referenced REST resource. 
  + `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the remote type referred by this relationship. 
  + `selector`:(string) An OData $filter expression which describes the REST resource to be referenced. This field maybe set instead of 'moid' by clients.1. If 'moid' is set this field is ignored.1. If 'selector' is set and 'moid' is empty/absent from the request, Intersight determines the Moid of theresource matching the filter expression and populates it in the MoRef that is part of the objectinstance being inserted/updated to fulfill the REST request.An error is returned if the filter matches zero or more than one REST resource.An example filter string is: Serial eq '3AA8B7T11'. 
* `configuration_type`:(HashMap) - The type of configuration, In-Band and/or Out-Of-Band to be configured on the CIMC. 
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `configure_inband`:(bool) This flag enables the use of In-Band configuration for end-point access.
