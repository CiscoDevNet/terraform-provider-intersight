# Resource: intersight_sol_policy
Policy for configuring Serial Over LAN settings on endpoint.
## Usage Example
### Resource Creation

```hcl
resource "intersight_sol_policy" "sol1" {
  name        = "sol2"
  description = "demo serial over lan policy"
  enabled     = false
  baud_rate   = 9600
  com_port    = "com1"
  ssh_port    = 1096
  organization {
    object_type = "organization.Organization"

## Argument Reference
The following arguments are supported:
* `account_moid`:(string)(ReadOnly) The Account ID for this managed object. 
* `ancestors`:(Array)(ReadOnly) An array of relationships to moBaseMo resources. 
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `moid`:(string) The Moid of the referenced REST resource. 
  + `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the remote type referred by this relationship. 
  + `selector`:(string) An OData $filter expression which describes the REST resource to be referenced. This field maybe set instead of 'moid' by clients.1. If 'moid' is set this field is ignored.1. If 'selector' is set and 'moid' is empty/absent from the request, Intersight determines the Moid of theresource matching the filter expression and populates it in the MoRef that is part of the objectinstance being inserted/updated to fulfill the REST request.An error is returned if the filter matches zero or more than one REST resource.An example filter string is: Serial eq '3AA8B7T11'. 
* `baud_rate`:(int) Baud Rate used for Serial Over LAN communication.* `9600` - Use baud rate 9600 for communication.* `19200` - Use baud rate 19200 for communication.* `38400` - Use baud rate 38400 for communication.* `57600` - Use baud rate 57600 for communication.* `115200` - Use baud rate 115200 for communication. 
* `com_port`:(string) Serial port through which the system routes Serial Over LAN communication. This field is available only on some Cisco UCS C-Series servers. If it is unavailable, the server uses COM port 0 by default.* `com0` - Use serial port com0 for communication.* `com1` - Use serial port com1 for communication.
