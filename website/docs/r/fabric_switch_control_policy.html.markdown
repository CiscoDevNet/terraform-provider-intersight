# Resource: intersight_fabric_switch_control_policy
A policy to configure the Switching Mode, Port VLAN Optimization, MAC Aging Time, Reserved VLAN Range of the FI.
## Usage Example
### Resource Creation

```hcl
resource "intersight_fabric_switch_control_policy" "fabric_switch_control_policy1" {
  name        = "fabric_switch_control_policy1"
  description = "fabric switch control policy"
  mac_aging_settings {
    mac_aging_option = "Custom"
    mac_aging_time   = 3000
    object_type      = "fabric.MacAgingSettings"
  }

## Argument Reference
The following arguments are supported:
* `account_moid`:(string)(ReadOnly) The Account ID for this managed object. 
* `ancestors`:(Array)(ReadOnly) An array of relationships to moBaseMo resources. 
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `moid`:(string) The Moid of the referenced REST resource. 
  + `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the remote type referred by this relationship. 
  + `selector`:(string) An OData $filter expression which describes the REST resource to be referenced. This field maybe set instead of 'moid' by clients.1. If 'moid' is set this field is ignored.1. If 'selector' is set and 'moid' is empty/absent from the request, Intersight determines the Moid of theresource matching the filter expression and populates it in the MoRef that is part of the objectinstance being inserted/updated to fulfill the REST request.An error is returned if the filter matches zero or more than one REST resource.An example filter string is: Serial eq '3AA8B7T11'. 
* `create_time`:(string)(ReadOnly) The time when this managed object was created. 
* `description`:(string) Description of the policy. 
* `domain_group_moid`:(string)(ReadOnly) The DomainGroup ID for this managed object. 
* `ethernet_switching_mode`:(string) Enable or Disable Ethernet End Host Switching Mode.* `end-host` - In end-host mode, the fabric interconnects appear to the upstream devices as end hosts with multiple links.In this mode, the switch does not run Spanning Tree Protocol and avoids loops by following a set of rules for traffic forwarding.In case of ethernet switching mode - Ethernet end-host mode is also known as Ethernet host virtualizer.* `switch` - In switch mode, the switch runs Spanning Tree Protocol to avoid loops, and broadcast and multicast packets are handled in the traditional way.This is the traditional switch mode. 
* `fabric_pc_vhba_reset`:(string) When enabled, a Registered State Change Notification (RSCN) is sent to the VIC adapter when any member port within the fabric port-channel goes down and vHBA would reset to restore the connection immediately. When disabled (default), vHBA reset is done only when all the members of a fabric port-channel are down.* `Disabled` - Admin configured Disabled State.* `Enabled` - Admin configured Enabled State. 
* `fc_switching_mode`:(string) Enable or Disable FC End Host Switching Mode.* `end-host` - In end-host mode, the fabric interconnects appear to the upstream devices as end hosts with multiple links.In this mode, the switch does not run Spanning Tree Protocol and avoids loops by following a set of rules for traffic forwarding.In case of ethernet switching mode - Ethernet end-host mode is also known as Ethernet host virtualizer.* `switch` - In switch mode, the switch runs Spanning Tree Protocol to avoid loops, and broadcast and multicast packets are handled in the traditional way.This is the traditional switch mode.
