# Resource: intersight_fabric_vlan
Configuration object for Virtual LAN.
## Usage Example
### Resource Creation

```hcl
resource "intersight_fabric_vlan" "fabric_vlan1" {
  auto_allow_on_uplinks = true
  is_native             = true
  name                  = "fabric_vlan1"
  vlan_id               = 10
  eth_network_policy {
    moid        = var.vnic_eth_network
    object_type = "fabric.EthNetworkPolicy"
  }
  multicast_policy {
    moid        = var.fabric_multicast_policy
    object_type = "fabric.MulticastPolicy"
  }
}

variable "vnic_eth_network" {
  type        = string
  description = "Moid of vnic_eth_network"
}

variable "fabric_multicast_policy" {
  type        = string
  description = "Moid of fabric_multicast_policy"
}
```
## Argument Reference
The following arguments are supported:
* `account_moid`:(string)(ReadOnly) The Account ID for this managed object. 
* `ancestors`:(Array)(ReadOnly) An array of relationships to moBaseMo resources. 
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `moid`:(string) The Moid of the referenced REST resource. 
  + `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the remote type referred by this relationship. 
  + `selector`:(string) An OData $filter expression which describes the REST resource to be referenced. This field maybe set instead of 'moid' by clients.1. If 'moid' is set this field is ignored.1. If 'selector' is set and 'moid' is empty/absent from the request, Intersight determines the Moid of theresource matching the filter expression and populates it in the MoRef that is part of the objectinstance being inserted/updated to fulfill the REST request.An error is returned if the filter matches zero or more than one REST resource.An example filter string is: Serial eq '3AA8B7T11'. 
* `auto_allow_on_uplinks`:(bool) Enable to automatically allow this VLAN on all uplinks. Disable must be specified for Disjoint Layer 2 VLAN configuration. Default VLAN-1 cannot be configured as Disjoint Layer 2 VLAN.

* `domain_group_moid`:(string)(ReadOnly) The DomainGroup ID for this managed object. 
* `eth_network_policy`:(HashMap) - A reference to a fabricEthNetworkPolicy resource.When the $expand query parameter is specified, the referenced resource is returned inline.
