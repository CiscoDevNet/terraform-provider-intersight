# Resource: intersight_workflow_service_item_health_check_definition
Service item health check definition metadata.
## Argument Reference
The following arguments are supported:
* `account_moid`:(string)(ReadOnly) The Account ID for this managed object. 
* `ancestors`:(Array)(ReadOnly) An array of relationships to moBaseMo resources. 
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `moid`:(string) The Moid of the referenced REST resource. 
  + `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the remote type referred by this relationship. 
  + `selector`:(string) An OData $filter expression which describes the REST resource to be referenced. This field maybe set instead of 'moid' by clients.1. If 'moid' is set this field is ignored.1. If 'selector' is set and 'moid' is empty/absent from the request, Intersight determines the Moid of theresource matching the filter expression and populates it in the MoRef that is part of the objectinstance being inserted/updated to fulfill the REST request.An error is returned if the filter matches zero or more than one REST resource.An example filter string is: Serial eq '3AA8B7T11'. 
* `category`:(string) Category that the health check belongs to. 
* `common_cause_and_resolution`:(string) Static information detailing the common cause for the health check failure.It also gives possible remediation actions that can be taken to remedy the health check failure. 
* `create_time`:(string)(ReadOnly) The time when this managed object was created. 
* `description`:(string) Description of the health check definition. 
* `domain_group_moid`:(string)(ReadOnly) The DomainGroup ID for this managed object. 
* `execution_mode`:(string) Execution mode of the health check on service item.* `OnDemand` - Execute the health check on-demand.* `Periodic` - Execute the health check on a periodic basis. 
* `health_check_workflow`:(HashMap) - Workflow that is associated with this health check definition. This workflow will be run on execution of the respective health check definition. 
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `catalog_moid`:(string) Specify the catalog moid that this workflow belongs. When catalog moid is not specified then the catalog of the service item is used first and if no workflow can be found in that catalog, then the shared catalog from Intersight is used. 
  + `description`:(string) The description of this workflow instance. 
  + `input_parameters`:(JSON as string) Capture the mapping of ActionDefinition inputDefinition to workflow definition. 
  + `label`:(string) A user defined label identifier of the workflow used for UI display. 
  + `name`:(string) The name of the workflow, this name must be unique across all the workflow definition used within the action definitions. 
  + `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type.The value should be the same as the 'ClassId' property. 
  + `nr_version`:(int) The workflow definition version to use as subworkflow. When no version is specified then the default version of the workflow at the time of creating or updating this workflow is used. 
  + `workflow_definition`:(HashMap) -(ReadOnly) The moid of the workflow definition.

If 'moid' is set this field is ignored.1. If 'selector' is set and 'moid' is empty/absent from the request, Intersight determines the Moid of theresource matching the filter expression and populates it in the MoRef that is part of the objectinstance being inserted/updated to fulfill the REST request.An error is returned if the filter matches zero or more than one REST resource.An example filter string is: Serial eq '3AA8B7T11'. 
  + `workflow_definition_name`:(string) The qualified name of workflow that should be executed.

* `owners`:
                (Array of schema.TypeString) -(ReadOnly)
* `parent`:(HashMap) -(ReadOnly) A reference to a moBaseMo resource.When the $expand query parameter is specified, the referenced resource is returned inline.
