# Resource: intersight_fabric_eth_network_group_policy
The allowed VLAN/s on an interface.
## Usage Example
### Resource Creation

```hcl
resource "intersight_fabric_eth_network_group_policy" "fabric_eth_network_group_policy1" {
  name        = "fabric_eth_network_group_policy1"
  description = "demo eth network group policy"
  vlan_settings {
    native_vlan   = 1
    allowed_vlans = "313,314,1000"
    object_type   = "fabric.VlanSettings"
  }
  organization {
    object_type = "organization.Organization"
    moid        = var.organization
  }
}
```
## Argument Reference
The following arguments are supported:
* `account_moid`:(string)(ReadOnly) The Account ID for this managed object. 
* `ancestors`:(Array)(ReadOnly) An array of relationships to moBaseMo resources. 
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `moid`:(string) The Moid of the referenced REST resource. 
  + `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the remote type referred by this relationship. 
  + `selector`:(string) An OData $filter expression which describes the REST resource to be referenced. This field maybe set instead of 'moid' by clients.1. If 'moid' is set this field is ignored.1. If 'selector' is set and 'moid' is empty/absent from the request, Intersight determines the Moid of theresource matching the filter expression and populates it in the MoRef that is part of the objectinstance being inserted/updated to fulfill the REST request.An error is returned if the filter matches zero or more than one REST resource.An example filter string is: Serial eq '3AA8B7T11'. 
* `create_time`:(string)(ReadOnly) The time when this managed object was created. 
* `description`:(string) Description of the policy.

* `name`:(string) Name of the concrete policy. 
* `organization`:(HashMap) - A reference to a organizationOrganization resource.When the $expand query parameter is specified, the referenced resource is returned inline.

* `shared_scope`:(string)(ReadOnly) Intersight provides pre-built workflows, tasks and policies to end users through global catalogs.Objects that are made available through global catalogs are said to have a 'shared' ownership. Shared objects are either made globally available to all end users or restricted to end users based on their license entitlement. Users can use this property to differentiate the scope (global or a specific license tier) to which a shared MO belongs. 
* `tags`:(Array)
This complex property has following sub-properties:

  + `version_type`:(string)(ReadOnly) Specifies type of version. Currently the only supported value is \ Configured\ that is used to keep track of snapshots of policies and profiles that are intendedto be configured to target endpoints.* `Modified` - Version created every time an object is modified.* `Configured` - Version created every time an object is configured to the service profile.* `Deployed` - Version created for objects related to a service profile when it is deployed. 
* `vlan_settings`:(HashMap) - VLAN configuration for the virtual interface. 
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `allowed_vlans`:(string) Allowed VLAN IDs of the virtual interface. A list of comma separated VLAN ids and/or VLAN id ranges. 
  + `native_vlan`:(int) Native VLAN ID of the virtual interface or the corresponding Vethernet on the peer Fabric Interconnect to which the virtual interface is connected. Native VLAN ID maps all incoming untagged traffic i.e. packets without a VLAN tag to the native VLAN for switching purposes. If the native VLAN is not a part of the allowed VLANs, it will automatically be added to the list of allowed VLANs. A native VLAN ID of 0 will indicate to the system to use the system default native VLAN ID and will also prevent native VLAN from being added to the allowed VLAN list. 
  + `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type.The value should be the same as the 'ClassId' property. 
  + `qinq_enabled`:(bool) Enable QinQ (802.1Q-in-802.1Q) Tunneling on the vNIC. 
  + `qinq_vlan`:(int) Select the VLAN ID for VIC QinQ (802.1Q-in-802.1Q) Tunneling.
